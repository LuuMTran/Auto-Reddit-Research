comments discussing characters of the game,Damn that’s high praise. I’m gonna have to check that shit out lol,0.6434902548789978
comments discussing characters of the game,Definitely do that. I noticed so many subtle details and character moments on my rewatch.,0.6437686681747437
comments discussing characters of the game,"that what i said to a friend today, i liked how Ellie fight that one guy in the TV station. I felt very realistic. I would have loved to see her sneak a bit in the hospital looking for Norah. no she just goes in a hole and find her. i get that you can’t have gameplay in a tv show, but i would have loved to see some tactics. And, being stealthy is one of the game option",0.609602153301239
comments discussing characters of the game,I think the Isaac scenes are a good addition. He was hyped up quite a bit in the game despite not being very present. An earlier introduction to him and more development is certainly a plus for me. There’s other stuff that could’ve been cut out.,0.668633759021759
comments discussing characters of the game,"Next to Abby at the hospital, that is the best gameplay of the game IMO",0.6097233295440674
comments discussing characters of the game,"I would've loved some scenes with her, as the therapist, sprinkled throughout the season as flashbacks. Talking to anyone in Jackson (focused on our main 5-6 characters, but really anyone). How's the war, attack, compound impacting their lives? This is an opportunity when changing mediums -- you don't have to focus on the player's character, you can take time with other characters and other POVs.
Instead, we've had some vague references to Joel killing her husband? And she knows that Ellie's a liar (great, so does anyone with eyes). Maybe I'm missing something deeper.
I liked the setting of the baseball game, though, since it showed that 'normal life' had returned to Jackson just 3 months after the horde attacked. Contrasted with Seattle and WLF camp where they're running drills and constantly in military mode (plus, no kids?).",0.6148003935813904
comments discussing characters of the game,"Have you even read the criticism thread? There’s very little, if any, criticism there that isn’t sincere and honest and when there is people tend to voice their disagreements right away. While I’ve no doubt review bombíng is actually happening, plenty of the criticisms are coming from people who really do love this property and want it to continue to be as good as it was in the games.",0.6457170844078064
comments discussing characters of the game,It's annoying because the game was legitimately review bombed when it came out so it's not like people are completely wrong for thinking it.,0.6003655195236206
comments discussing characters of the game,"It also has a legitimately polarising storyline but its difficult to debate in good faith due the risk of looking like one of those

comments discussing characters of the game,"Same here. I’m amazed how quickly fans of the show are shitting on people for their valid criticisms. It’s just kind of heartbreaking seeing the direction they’ve taken the show. 
I hate being lumped in with the morons that violently hated the game. ",0.6261990666389465

comments discussing characters of the game,"Man its Not reviewbombing, at least the majority isnt. This show really has legit problems with writing, especially compared to the game.
The story itself is controversial for sure. But the show doesnt do it any favor at all. Making weird changes to characters. Inconsistant tone. Ellie that just mentally didnt aged 5 years.
Technically its fine. Actors do the best with what they get. But it just isnt on the level it needs to be",0.6062446236610413
comments discussing characters of the game,"The writing is my biggest issue. Is it really review bombing when everyone has valid complaints? I mean they changed so much in terms of characters personalitys that theyre not even the same characters anymore. Even from a stand alone show at this point, the characters all feel off and don't make sense.",0.6013913154602051
comments discussing characters of the game,"I, for one, love the show. I’ve played the games four times each, favorite games of all time. I don’t understand why people feel like the show has to be exactly like the game. It can be its own thing and still capture the essence of the game. I feel like the show is doing that pretty darn well, and I honestly feel like a lot of people are just so fragile and “hurt” every time an adaption isn’t executed exactly to their liking. That’s not how adaptations work.",0.6205301284790039
comments discussing characters of the game,People that are saying it's not review bombing need to wake up. This IS reviewing bombing. Aside from a few changes the show has been faithful to the game. Yes you can have your criticism but this is excessive. .,0.6170099377632141
comments discussing characters of the game,"I really dont want any kind of association with the neckbeard sexists who bombed the game, bc PtII my favorite narrative arguably ever.
But the show has just not been doing the story justice. They clearly want to tell a different story and while thats not a bad thing, they should have just done a different story/different characters",0.6740197539329529

comments discussing characters of the game,The game was great but this season is missing the mark for me,0.601662278175354
comments discussing characters of the game,"I find it funny how the game fan threads and show only threads are night and day with response 😂
Personally, I think people are attached to the way the game told the story that they can’t accept the show. I don’t think there’s much substantive difference which is probably why show only fans tend to like it more. They have nothing to compare it to and can accept the story for what it is.",0.6428552269935608
comments discussing characters of the game,"Not surprised. The game mostly just had incels/Red pillers review bombing. The show has those people, PLUS the people who loved Part 2 that are pissed at the changes",0.6853264570236206
comments discussing characters of the game,"That’s sad. The season imo is really not good at all save for individual scenes, but not for any of the reasons these clowns are review bombing it for.
Game is great, so I’m feeling really let down how poorly written season 2 has been. If anything it highlights how good the game really is. All the scenes that really pull you in are pretty much just taken straight from the game almost beat for beat with dialogue as well.",0.6092303991317749
comments discussing characters of the game,I think people who constantly attack Bella Ramsey's looks and who already hated the second game and never planned on watching this earnestly give everyone a real good cop out for a valid criticism because I'm willing to bet a decent amount of the reviews are not review bombing and not hate watching but just people who are genuinely invested in season 1 being reasonably critical of season 2,0.6097558736801147
comments discussing characters of the game,"Not to be mean... but if the game gets review bombed, and the show gets review bombed in the same parts of the game and show... maybe it's just people reviewing?
HBO show was amazingly well liked but it was rushed in worse ways than S2. They literally skipped like 60% of the game story and the literal ending is about 10 minutes when it should, by it's own right, be about an episode alone.",0.6019431352615356
comments discussing characters of the game,I don’t know. I’m enjoying it. Not as good as the game for sure but still good. Looking forward to next episode as always.,0.6262200474739075

comments discussing characters of the game,"From that review, it sounds like it follows the game flow closely and does probably end there. They bring up being frustrated at how there's not much info given on the other characters, and of course in the game that's all loaded in the back half.",0.6406557559967041
comments discussing characters of the game,"That is such a good scene. I've watched quite a few playthroughs of the game by different streamers and it is just fascinating to watch the general attitude towards characters change over time.
Such great story telling.",0.6751416325569153
comments discussing characters of the game,"i feel like the one person who loved the gameplay but thought the story was just okay, for both games.
tbf most videogame stories are just okay.",0.604945957660675
comments discussing characters of the game,"I think it's the character exploration that people respond to, which is very solid for a video game. The actual story/plot is a bit ludicrous in places. Characters zoom around the zombie-filled, post-apocalyptic United States with way too ease, even accepting that Ellie and Joel had a car for some of it (and we'll glide over the fact that gasoline is unusable after a couple of years left in a fuel tank, so no cars should be operational at all at this point of the story, something even The Walking Dead gets right after the Season 9 time-jump out of the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse). Ellie is also the freaking Terminator in the second game, annihilating entire platoons of trained soldiers and hives of infected that would have given ex-soldier Joel pause in the first game.
There's a lot of decisions in the second game that they make in the service of ""BIGGER, LONGER, MORE EXPLOSIONS!"" that are just very dumb. Which is a shame as the central story idea and premise is pretty strong. I'm hoping the show enhances that and ignores some of the crazier setpieces that defy rationality.",0.6297115683555603
comments discussing characters of the game,"I kinda disagree, I feel a lot of the game, even the second, is there to be a game. There are sections that are just there for gameplay and not necessarily plot purposes.
In a show you don't really need to have these and I think the show largely benefited from skipping most of the game events past Henry and Sam.",0.6083888411521912
comments discussing characters of the game,"I agree somewhat, but still feel like the ending in the game is more impactful than the ending in the show because of how compressed Joel and Ellie’s relationship is in the show. Granted they couldn’t have 5 more episodes of them just trauma-bonding through insane survival experiences, but I can’t blame someone for not feeling as strongly about the ending as I did if they didn’t play the game.",0.6278666257858276
comments discussing characters of the game,"Just fyi, there's a bunch of spoilers for the whole season in that review, even more egregious if you know the game.",0.6154170632362366
comments discussing characters of the game,"I was really hoping we’d get some more backstory on her, but yeah it seems like she’s WLF
that sounds like it could be an amazing story, and she gets talked about for a grand total of like five lines in the game. Kinda sad the show doesn’t seem interested in exploring that considering what they did with Bill and Frank.",0.6007134914398193
comments discussing characters of the game,"And there seems to be even more people pretending one critic's opinion is an objective quality of the show...
I thought this article was well written - and having played the game, I can understand why the finale could be unfulfilling as described by the author. But I haven't seen it yet, so I'm reserving judgment!",0.6302713751792908

comments discussing characters of the game,"Imo, what the show (and the game) should've done is switching Ellie and Abby's halfs of the game. Introducing Abby at the start and having the the twist of Joel being her father's killer and her killing Joel at the end would've been better imo.",0.6290615797042847

comments discussing characters of the game,It had the gamergate crew screeching because of a trans character and then about Abbie's physique. Then you had fans that took the early game twist involving a golf club way to seriously leading to harassment and threats against gaming VA treasure Laura Bailey,0.6403610706329346
comments discussing characters of the game,"Close! Everyone was upset about a trans character that wasn't even trans, just muscular (because obviously women can't be muscular).

comments discussing characters of the game,"I followed that mess at the time and Laura Bailey said she got one in regards to her two year old child. Threating to harm anyone, especially someone’s baby, for playing a character you don’t like in a game you didn’t even play is incredibly pathetic.

comments discussing characters of the game,"The impressions I've gotten from the reviews I've read are that there's a lot of gore in the surrounding environment, but the action is going to be far more pulpy than the game, which makes sense.

Length of shader comp - Don't complain, otherwise you have a dead space where it doesn't do it properly, and you still have stutter
Crashes - valid complaint
Mouse issues - valid complaint
Fuck iron galaxy - Unhelpful
Get nixxes - The spiderman ports also had issues
High vram - Somewhat valid, depends how the game scales to lower texture settings (And this assumes you're targeting the appropriate settings for your VRAM)

comments discussing characters of the game,"i imagine those people to just be basement dwelling neckbeards that have one area of their life they can control: videogames. And Neil gave them a bold story that says all characters are gray, no true good and evil, where the result was not a typical hero story and they couldn't handle it. Part 2 is a great story that I think will fit nicely in a trilogy. Anyway, super excited for the show, I hope people that didn't play the game will love it.",0.6322730779647827
comments discussing characters of the game,"Part 2 is my favourite videogame ever, hands down - but I think it's worth having some empathy for the basement dwelling neckbeards here. I don't think it was the greyness of the story they couldn't handle, it was Joel's story and what that meant for the player character.
Videogames are wish fulfilment, people experience these power fantasies through the main character and become attached to them. From all the hate I've read online that is the one thing that sticks out, how much people couldn't handle the loss of Joel, and completely rejected Abby because of it. I've seen so much pseudo media analysis from people trying to legitimise the lack of connection they felt for that character. Now I can't really say if it's just because she killed Joel or whether her being a butch, not-typically-sexy woman was part of that also, but given the history of that corner of the internet it would hardly surprise.
This isn't meant as a criticism by the way, I think they made one of the best videogames ever, but dismissing the backlash as a bunch of trolls being trolls misses out the insight into just how much people connect with the characters they play as, and how blinded they can be to everything else when that connection is disrupted.",0.6137858033180237

The games do a good job of balancing the quips etc. In the movie it felt like they were trying to 'one up' each other with one liners the whole time.
I've got no issue with the movie not really being true to the games or anything. It's an adaptation, if I'd want the exact same thing I'll play the games :) But I do love the cheesy adventure vibe of the games, which the movie just didn't have.

Their opinion is not more valuable than anyone else's. It's just more valuable than the army of salty fanboys who review bombed the game literally within hours of its release, where it was physically impossible to have finished the game.
But if you really want to know why these people deserve credibility, it's because their job is to specifically review games for the purpose of understanding why they're good (and bad). Their job is to inform Microsoft of the competition and instruct them on how Microsoft might be able to one-up them or at the very least match them. This review understood the game intimately, it seems, and was even more critical of its gameplay than most reviewers. They understood why it was so absolutely amazing and even gave advice on how developers might be able to steer their games in the future, narratively. This review was meant for internal use only and it had to be 100% honest. After all, why would Microsoft pay a team of people to review a game and lie about it? It makes no sense.

""How good/bad"" is a reductive measure for art. The Kotaku review argued the point that the grim brutality of the game overpowers any other message or theme. That's a fair point. But, many people would say the same about the work of Cormac McCarthy or Dostoevsky. Hell, people said that about Red Dead Redemption 2 and Death Stranding (which I loved and finished, respectively.)

As fucking if I would let my adopted daughter die for a CHANCE at creating an immunisation for something that has already destroyed society and most of the world.
The actions these characters took throughout their journey were, I would personally say, overly sympathetic. Every single person they killed gave them no other choice and every opportunity they had bar one to be non-combative and still safe, they took.
Yeah I'm gonna feel sad having to murder an animal, hear realistic death yelps and the owner crying in shock, but in a world like that the developers have got to be absolutely insane to think they can guilt-trip the player into thinking ""oh maybe I didn't have to shoot those rapist cannibals maybe they were nice deep down""

Don't get me wrong - it's fine to disagree with her conclusion, but it just weirds me out how r/games tends to always be on the forefront of lamenting the homogenization of game reviews.

However I find it a bit weird nobody is talking about the gameplay in this comment section because IT ACTUALLY SOUNDS GREAT. This looks like an amazing stealth game with probably the best AI behavior I've ever seen in a stealth game. I don't really care if the story is bleak and hopeless and all that shit.

comments discussing characters of the game,"[SPOILER FREE] Story: Its great fun and compelling doest go the way people wanted and goes for a darker less forgiving tone where the characters actions have consequencess, great game overall great characters and smart writting and fantastic performances makes you understand both sides rlly well. The criticism the game is getting is unfair as people either haven't played the game and based it off leaks and just see important clips of the game or they fail to understand that not everthing goes the way you want and not everyone needs to die in a glorious way. The gameplay : Its feels so amazing the shotting mechanics are impactful and when u get hit you feel it grabbing someone as a hostage for a few seconds making enemies not shoot feels so badass. The hand to hand is so grounded and immersive the dodge mechanic is rlly well placed and the immense variety of animations and combos is unreal i am on the 2nd play through and have seen many that i did not see before The stealth is one of the best out there to lying under truck or lying in grass the animations look so smooth they nailed it it all feels like ome big set piece and npcs feel smart they dont just stand there they interact with stuff they look around, if they are talking from a distance and u kill one of the people mid sentence people will investigate as to why he stopped talking also dogs are a new addition and makes the game even more tense Visuals/sound: One of the best if not the most gorgeous and detailed games out there the various landscapes are all stunning and compelling, each are that u come across looks unbelievable so detailed. The sound is something naughty dog always nails and they haven't with part 2 either Overall i think naughty took a risk in story and alot of people didn't like it along with the leaks thag put people off game leaks with no context the game is worth a try to judge for yourself and not jump on the bandwagon like so many are its truly a masterpiece one of the best games os this generation and a great sequel dark intense sequel that makes you feel so many emotions and they accomplished what they wanted",0.6191585063934326
comments discussing characters of the game,"Awesome thread that was worth the read but I still have some thoughts:
So Mavuika is the exact opposite of Furina but share the same human tenacity? Mav had a ton of references on how she was supposed to conduct herself, act like a true leader, and what she needed to do but didn’t realize that she as the individual mattered as much as the whole of Natlan. Furi on the other hand was thrown into the wolves and all Focalors gave her was “Here’s your task! Good luck lmao” and worried so much about her own individual importance in how she would save Fontaine that she didn’t realize everyone else had a role to play as well. Despite both being human they sacrificed who they were as a person in pursuit of saving their nation but their human resolve was what helped them complete their task.
I’m guessing that Mav’s cute quirks and uniqueness will show up later as she unwinds and more people will eventually start liking her like how everyones’s view of Furi did a 180 after the final act of Fontaine. Natlan’s not over yet and neither is Mav’s story (I know I’m comparing Mav to Furi a lot)
I think the new method of storytelling threw a lot of people in for a loop. Hiding a lot of context within the world quests and not keeping it within the archon quests was a bad move on Hoyo’s part especially given that many people already don’t like reading (or thinking) and often skip world quests. If they had started with this method of storytelling from the beginning or tried it in a different game I think it would have been received better.
Natlan’s story could have also had some more social commentary and some conflicts between playable characters within the “good side” to make it feel as realistic as the other nations.",0.6054325103759766
comments discussing characters of the game,"I highly disagree with this. You're getting having flaws mixed up with being a good leader.
We can absolutely have a competent archon who heroically leads their nation. But there still needs to be more substance if you want to make them an actual character. What obstacles does she face in the story. Does she hesitate to sacrifice her memorabilia? No she just casually does it. Are some Natlan tribes unsure about following her plan? Nope, everyone loves her and trusts her wholeheartedly. Does meeting Hime in the night realm throw a monkey wrench into the plan and add in a conflict like a choice for her to handle as a leader? Nope that moment is completely meaningless.
People don't demand incompetence, people demand three dimensional trait, which is basic character writing 101. Mavuika herself has basically none of that. That's why this writeup focuses so much on her symbolic interaction with the lore. Because as a character she has basically nothing except ""good leader"" and ""rides a motorcycle"". They could've took her 500 year timeleap backstory out of the game and literally nothing would be different.",0.6057711839675903

I really like Mavuika and she is a very interesting character but like you said, her story and character is not quite in your face like the other Archons. Reading Mavuika character stories is a must in my opinion.

Dreaming Deep should allow you to start with any character you already own at least. And you don't even have the flexibility to try out other characters cause your build relies on team buffs.
I completely dislike how kuro handles release of new 5* characters. They shouldn't be as reliant on other premium characters. All it does is kill all the will to pull them at all cause I don't want a crippled 5* that can't function without other 5* (I know it's a team based game but before you had options in 4* which didn't completely change the playstyle forcing quickswap)",0.6136501431465149

Also can you please add this to the list :
Events: well tbh pretty similar with the events suggestion you have so i wont add here
Characters:
- Balance Male to Female characters, I would like if they balance the amount since in my opinion it is pretty jarring considering the amount (as a female player who loves both the Female and Male characters or the game, I know they could do well and they also design good characters overall)
-Buffing old units both 5 and 4 stars, I genuinely love the 4 stars we have and would love just try and match up team comps (I love Aalto's taunts and also really interested with Yuanwu gameplay and ofc theirs our girls Sanhua and Danjin the goats and also fixing Taoqis gameplay, she seems interesting but quite weak)
- Having more 4 stars with good kits since I feel it can be at least an alternative if players pulling in the banner cant get the 5 star they are targeting for
Farming:
- Increase in Crystalline and Crystal solvent and the likes since us players are farming more now
-Ability to ad a specific name for the markers ex: Mining marker - Label: Mining for ""Specific ore""
Quest:
It would be nice if we have clips of like the cutscene we experienced in game (like unlockable in game) and it would be stored in Gallery, then we can have both the pics and scenes (I love rewatching wuwa scenes in YT, but I would love seeing them while in game too)",0.6280196309089661

It's more of a Quality of Life improvement rather than gameplay feeadback and should consider making a different category of requests rather than feedback
Same goes for 3d Character details, i hope you do realise most of these features are mostly ""Normal"" or ""Height"" texture data that gives a 3d look on a 2d plane which makes the game itself work lighter than it should be. If it were to be 3d Meshes then you would be expecting your system to calculate more voxel data which is Gpu or Cpu Intensive.

I would suggest that before Rinacita ends we get a 4 star for each element debuff or at the very least if that's too much work an echo with high uptime that can apply things like Spectro frazze/Aero erosion and stuff like that. Or even add to existing echo's that are good, like the pyro lizards so that team comps are not super dependant on getting X character with X debuff to make meta dps good.",0.6482687592506409

comments discussing characters of the game,"Thank you for posting, that is so detailed. I think my complaints are included in these, but i will type it all over again, for my next survey yap 1. Less RNG in echo, farming and stat, this basically fixes most of my issues about the game. 2. Older somnoires/maps (1.x msq or companion quests) unlock for revisit 3. Considering giving older characters screentime, stories or upgrades (they dont sell as hard but cmon) 4. Training room and Housing system. I want to practice with different teams and look at my characters in a house together. 5. More team comp option, fixing team choosing UI, mentioned above. 6. Tone down obvious predatory practices (mentioned in the battle pass section and in character restrictive gameplay design) 7. Actual meaningful QoLs, like unlimited flying, gacha 5050 guarantee or echo stat roll guarantee. 8. (my opinion) characters and story with built up, better lore and lore presentation. 9. (my opinion) gallery for rewatching cutscenes or story quests. I know people have problems with their hard drive but i wish to appreciate them again.
Well that is basically my yap. Will come back if i remember things i want to complain about again.",0.6113510131835938

comments discussing characters of the game,"I started this game nearly 3 weeks ago, but honestly I agree with a lot of this. Nightmarket was really bad for the f2p portion (not to mention giving weapon skins instead of the actual weapons to new players so they have something to work with aside from the terrible 4* options). Derby was nice but restricted times made it such a hassle to keep track of.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I think this game is very grounded in feminist values, and I think that was very intentional. Most of the major characters are women, and they’re not straightjacketed in the same way that female characters often are.
That said I don’t think it’s the central theme. Other themes are way more directly grappled with, such as what strength means in regards to fighting for others vs fighting for control of others, the dangers of blind faith, environmentalist themes, motherhood and the value of self sacrifice, and capitalism. Characters and bits of lore actually engage with these themes directly.
Again I think this game is 100% shaped by feminist values but don’t think that makes it the central theme",0.6453112363815308

comments discussing characters of the game,"i feel like the reason none of us saw it that way is because we all knew the component parts that made the game feminist, in detail, yet didn't feel compelled to compress it into that one word
for example, we can say it promotes a healthy version of positive masculinity even in a tiny singing bug (Sherma), note that i have seen people actually uncomfortable finding out he is male due to his presentation as feminine by western standards.
we can also say it is against authoritarian regime, in general.
in most people's minds, feminism is just the resistance of the patriarchy, and given that the main antagonist is a matriarch, the game doesn't seem like a game ABOUT feminism, but just a feminist game. it's not so much a lesson as it is something baked into the world, and as a man i can resonate with a lot of the morals of the game.
call me stupid, but i feel like the massively encompassing academic definition of feminism here doesn't align with the contemporary one (which is just ""resist the patriarchy"", usually the removal of gender-construct oppression from women and lower-class men)",0.6124287843704224
comments discussing characters of the game,"this is an incredibly well-thought-out write up, thanks so much for posting it and letting us read! i agree that there seems to be weirdly little mention of the obvious theme of capitalist exploitation in Underworks. Loam especially does so much for the worldbuilding with such little dialogue, and he's where a few of the themes that you talk about tie together *in-game* for me -- his line about ""unworthy hope"" when Hornet tells him she is not a Citadel resident come to take him up implies so much about the utility of the Citadel's theology in keeping bugs working and docile. Finding the ""our hate is forever"" slab next to the hidden bench in Bilewater was one of the moments that stuck with me the most in my first playthrough for a similar reason: it communicates SO MUCH about the human (insectoid?) cost of building and sustaining the Citadel's grandeur",0.6254708170890808

comments discussing characters of the game,"I don't know what statement they could make with that beyond showing the many possibilities of social/familial arrangements, but I think that's pretty cool on its own.
i think this is exactly the statement the game want to make. just within this post, there are argument about how men/women are DNA-coded to do certain things and fatherhood/motherhood is going to have only one path forward. my argument is to point out no, the game wants you to see that there are indeed many different possibilities of social/familial arrangements. And while we can judge whether one arrangement is good or bad based on different standards, we should recognize that we are reacting based on how we see the result of those arrangements on the children/the dependents. just take note of the reaction of Hornet and us as players when we relate to these characters.
Also, I think the game is really good in dealing with the concept of anti essentialism and that's a really good way to deal with gendered issues even beyond motherhood. 
this is amazing stuff and really makes writing this nearly 4k words essay worth it :'(( completely miss how Hornet changing herself and other nuggest add to anti-essentialism. thank you so much for pointing that out, for your time reading and writing this comment. appreciate you being a part of this amazingly wholesome community!",0.6554127931594849

comments discussing characters of the game,"I mean you touched on many points in a really deep way, I’m a queer activist and I felt really represented in the way Hornet was portrayed, at least through that perspective.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I think you are making the mistake of taking an assortment of common tropes in media that happen to be in Silksong and weaving a narrative that tries to fit all of them together.
Also I'm not sure if I buy using the argument of intersectionality to relate everything you mentioned back to ""feminism"". By this thread of logic practically anything can be argued as a prominent theme in the game. If TC wanted feminism to be a prominent theme of the game it would be a lot less subtle.
I'm not saying feminism cannot be construed as a message conveyed by the game. But there are much more prominent themes that stand out to me (immortality vs death, faith, power/control, etc.) I do agree with the things you insinuated about organized religion and environmental degradation though.",0.6010773777961731
comments discussing characters of the game,"I think most good media can have many interpretations. The game is what you make of it.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Rather than writing a long response I'll just steal the opinion of the commenter above and build from it. While I concede that most of your analysis is logically sound if we agree with your basic principles and definitions, I do believe that basis is built on views and interpretation of terms that are let's say, niche to specific feminist circles. So I don't think feminism was what Team Cherry designed the game as being about. What I mean is that, as a writer, I'm sure a future reader of my own comics could totally make a detailed analysis about how my story is actually about feminism. And while I care about many things like female representation, no it was not my intention. However I do believe in the inherent value of personal interpretations, no matter whether ""correct"" or not. The opposite would be rich from someone who made 5 video essays on feminism in Kill la Kill. So yours was an interesting read indeed.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Exactly - as you say, intelligently written and some accurate/valid points about the themes of capitalism, class, and imperialism/colonialism etc present in the game (although at the same time, not exactly ground breaking - the game is hardly subtle or complex when it comes to these points/critiques), but questions of gender/feminism just aren't present in any meaningful sense (I.e. in my opinion, analysing the game from a feminist perspective doesn't provide any signficant or novel insight relative to an equivalent, non-gender-based reading).
Just because a game has a female protagonist doesn't mean it has (meaningful/significant) feminist themes. The fact that Hornet is female is essentially incidental rather than being central to or driving the plot etc.
The difficulty when it comes to this topic is that the broader landscape of how ""feminism"" is perceived by male gamers is toxic, such that arguing against feminist readings/positions inevitably risks one being perceived as being/supporting antifeminist positions. To be clear, my problem isn't with feminist readings/analysis, but rather with the application of a feminist reading in this specific case (as I just don't think it provides any novel insight or utility)",0.6291741132736206

comments discussing characters of the game,"incredibly well formed analysis, but i think even in your own analysis you seem to contend with the fact that feminst themes are not necessarily the central one of the game. personally though, i think your analysis really shed some light for me on how feminist themes do play into the central message of the game, specifically in the termination of generational maternal trauma, especially as a metaphor for capitalism. throughout the game the way gms created the society, and crucially the citadel and underworks areas of pharloom is shown to be intertwined with her children, the weavers. herrah breaking free from the cycle of abuse and hornet carrying that on is literally how hornet becomes a better version of herself and makes the society of pharloom better.
ill take the time to write a full analysis later, but before i go id like to note that as per your comment on english not being your first language you have fluency and command of english i only see from those who have closely studied its craft. your tone is clear and mellifluous, and your prose is concise and direct in a way that shows the immense effort you've put into it. additionally your formatting and grammar indicate a level of perfectionism suited to higher platforms than reddit, and i'm not sure your technical skill level would be completely out of place in the annals of famous novelists and poets; it's very well constructed is my point.",0.6504107713699341

comments discussing characters of the game,"This is incredibly well written! I think you have a great mind for storytelling and narritive analysis, and honestly if you were to put this into a video format on youtube I think it'd hit trending within a week. I'm only about halfway into the game I think but I've noticed many of the points you bring up in-game, minus anything to do with the final boss (or anything from act 3 rather).
I only have two criticisms, which may have just stemmed from english not being your first language as you said, but I believe you mean ""feminity"" as opposed to ""feminism,"" as a major theme in the game. The criticism of capitalism is there, but it appears to be more of a criticism of greed and industrialization, not inherently capitalism. Alternatively, I was thinking ""late stage capitalism"" is more apt than just capitalism.
Above all thank you for the read, it was awesome!",0.6301593780517578

The characters absolutely fit their role and their genders, nothing feels forced, it feels right even. To me at least, it all felt like it was just normal, no message, that's just how things are.
Maybe it's because a lot of modern media tries to be as political as possible and show it, so we get poorly made, oversaturated, not genuene characters that have their entire personally based on their gender, race or sexuality - they don't feel like actual people. And now when I see something that feels genuene and natural, it feels, well, normal, I'd say even too normal to be considered political",0.6071411371231079

comments discussing characters of the game,"Most comments I've seen since the june reveal have been ""where muh multiplayer"" and ""it looks the same"".
I swear Factions wasn't this big of a deal back in 2013 but now it seems to be the hill to die on. I also feel like the gameplay and graphics comments are at best made with rose tinted glasses and at worst are just disingenuous. I mean just look at the Digital Foundry tech review. Not only are the graphics basically remade with models, world and effects being improved but also the cutscenes down to the directing and camera angles of the scenes, not to mention they are completely real time now. The gameplay also seems improved with better AI and changes to the physics and gunplay. While Joel isn't diving and dodging around like a madman in conveniently placed patches of high grass it's still an improvement.
Now, I'll admit 70€ is a bit steep but to call this just a cash grab isn't fair to Naughty Dog. It is a cash grab in the sense that it costs money (crazy, huh?!) and the PS4 is cheaper but it also seems to be the definitive version for a critically acclaimed single player story with real work and care being put into the game.

comments discussing characters of the game,"The first game was clear on that with the DLC though? It was them being pissed off about Joel getting killed and the transphobia around Abby.

Then we got hordes of posts about how a girl's body can't look like that, she must be a man, protein powder and constant workouts can't give a woman that kind of body, etc etc.
The main reason I can remember is because my complaint wasn't about either of those things but because right wingers and transphobes were all over anything that didn't praise the game, they latched onto my comment. (For the record, my comment was about Druckmann saying if he made TLOU2 it would be about new characters and that Joel and Ellie's stories were over. I think when you have a world as big as this, it's more enticing to see what is going on elsewhere than falling back to the safety of established characters. I would've been happy if we spent 90% of the game as Abby and had a surprise final showdown with Ellie where you got clues of what happened but it really clicked then. I would've been happier if we never saw a tie to Ellie or Joel ever again.)",0.6520888209342957

comments discussing characters of the game,"I read the entire review and I think it's mostly pretty good at explaining its issues with the season... But that final paragraph is bizarre.
A lot of the review praises the game in part because it is extremely willing to withhold things from the player. It takes forever for the player to learn why certain characters do what they do. Or why certain characters aren't on talking terms. It allows the player to float in that uncertainty. But apparently the show is borderline afraid of that and goes out of its way to explain character motives and relationships, themes, you name it.
I get why a reviewer might have a problem with that. And it kinda sounds like the reviewer thinks that the show is intentionally reducing potential discomfort. But that final paragraph really just seems to frame it as something that's sort of inherent to TV?
I don't disagree that a game being interactive does have the potential of making uncomfortable parts even more uncomfortable. But it's wild to extrapolate that mediums that lack interactivity shouldn't even try to subject viewers to discomfort from that.",0.6214080452919006

comments discussing characters of the game,"He was like Mr Woo in the game. Constantly mentioned by different characters but barely in it himself.
Orson Welles said that it's the best kind of character to play in a play because in the first two acts everyone is mentioning Mr. Woo and how scary and important and terrifying he is before Mr. Woo makes a single appearance before the interval. Then, during the break the audience goes to get a drink and say, ""oh, how good is that Mr Woo, so threatening etc."".

comments discussing characters of the game,"From the Variety review:
Yet Dever [Abby] is a surprisingly marginal presence here, billed as a guest star and deployed sparingly.
Sounds like we’re going to be more or less following the game’s structure when it comes to Abby and Ellie’s storylines. Curious to see what the reactions are going to be next season when Abby becomes the protagonist. It wouldn’t be a bad stylistic choice if the show was able to be binged like the game, but it could go very wrong when the tv audience has to wait each week only to keep on discovering that Ellie won’t reenter the narrative until the end and it’s Abby’s story for the season.",0.623367428779602

comments discussing characters of the game,"I know he did go on record in a video saying he “didn’t even want to play it anymore” after he saw the leaked footage. I dunno whether his perspective has changed after considering the game as a whole, but since he was so quick to write it off without seeing the finished product, I’m leery of what he will have to say. Wouldn’t be surprised if he never gave it a fair shake. But maybe he ended up liking it, or maybe it wasn’t for him but he will still have a fair and constructive analysis to share.
The thing with most YouTube “reviewers” is that they are first and foremost entertainers. Even ones I agree with in general, I take their reviews with a grain of salt. And while Joe has been around a long time, he really goes all in on the entertainer angle with skits and over the top reactions.

comments discussing characters of the game,"His review is out already and it was exactly what was expected.
It's not bad at all, he does give out some fair points for why he didn't like it but at the same time I just can't really fully consider his opinion when he clearly went in it with an almost fixed mindset after the leaks and the way he seemed to be unwilling to actually give it a chance.
He does present some fair argument against it and I understood most of it but he also goes on this rant about how basically everyone knows better then the people who actually created the characters about what the plot could've been and It's kinda funny to me because pandering to the ""woke community"" would have been outrageous which is proven by the reaction and how everyone jumped into assumptions after the leaks but had they made a fan service story, had they played it safe and made something to satisfy fans wants instead of the story they wanted to tell (aka pandering) that would have been 100% okay.
At the end of the day, I understand and can definitely see why some people didn't or won't like the story but saying this game had lazy writing and basically going on and on about how they should've done what the fans wanted is just not a valid argument for a reviewer who should have the capability of being objective and rational in my opinion.
He also contradicts himself sometimes. I mean, 6/10 is a fair rating... had he not spent 90% of the video pointing out all the wrong things they did and barely mentioning what he thought they did right. Hell, he even says in the end that gameplay was one of the things they did well yet earlier in the video he's going on about how they've only added prone...

They had a really hard task and I definitely agree that if they had indeed done a lot of what people have been saying they should've done instead, they'd still get backlash anyways hence why I think doing what they wanted to do with the story even with all that weight on their shoulders was the right choice.",0.6020370721817017

But if someone doesnt like or agree with Ellie forgiving Abby, they missed the point of this game. I loved Abby as a character.

By the end, you're supposed to not want either to die. Ellie breaks the cycle of violence last. This key moment is something haters don't agree with. They are blindly rabid for Joel's vengeance.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I disagree with your assertion wholeheartedly. Not thinking Abby was worth redeeming is not mutually exclusive with Ellie as well. What if after all is said and done you think neither character is worth redeeming? Personally, I don't care that much about Joel, I liked him and was sad when he died but I would never consider myself a major Joel fan. It's immensely frustrating being written off as a ""rabid Joel fan/hater"" when presented with dissenting view points from people loving the game. FWIW I liked it overall but there are some glaring issues, and I, personally, think most of that lies on how Abby was characterized.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Angry Joe came out with his review. He gave it a 6/10. 5 years from now these review scores are going to look like jokes when the culture wars over this game dies down.
A game that has this many industry leading aspects from animation, voice acting dialogue writing, atmosphere, combat movement, stealth gameplay etc getting a 6 just because you disagree with story direction is silly.
Another thing he doesn't realize is how much of an influence he is to the gaming community. 15-25 year olds are his core base and that age group has issues with thinking for themselves. They latch on to influencer opinions. Angry Joe for all his hatred of monotization, lazy publishers etc is going to influence the gaming industry to push out generic trash and not take risks.
What's even more sad is if the leaks didn't come out where a multi-month campaign by alt-right YouTubers didn't spam hatred for the game making it the mainstream narrative amongst young YouTube viewers based on the leaks, Angry Joe would probably be praising this game.

Edit: And what's interesting and I think masterful of the game is that it challenges you to be empathetic to, emotionally invested in, two characters who hate and want to kill each other. At the same time.
You see both of them as part of your ""tribe,"" they're both ""the good guys,"" but they both see each other as the villain.

You can hate the story or events that happen, but they used some cool literary tools: 1) Full circle ending. The game begins and ends with the guitar, symbolizing different perspectives before and after the story. I mean we talk about full circle ending as a tool in English classes for writing. It’s used brilliantly here. 2) the character perspectives and plot are mirrored, which is just cool. You get Ellie on this light path going darker as a person, and Abby on a dark path getting lighter as a person. In the beginning, Abby has a brief playable section where she’s a shady figure before “you know what” happens. At the end, Abby is a briefly playable figure (Santa Barbara) on a light path. I mean love or hate it, that’s just a cool narrative technique. 3) symbols everywhere! The meaning of the moth (in the darkness searching for the light), fits the whole narrative. The meaning of music to Ellie. The meaning of the aquarium to Abby and how that evolves as the story and tone change. Joel’s song Future Days, while on the nose, foreshadows the whole game. 4) Abby’s story begins with “you know what”, and ends with her basically copying Joel’s story from the first game. She becomes “Joel” by adopting Lev and overcoming her sense of “the other”, which Abby has been to us for the entire plot.
Again I’m not trying to make you like the game. I’m just trying to point out, if you dissect this structure in like an English class or literature class, there are cool tools used here that just aren’t used commonly in video games. Not on this level. That’s an artistic achievement on a mechanical level for the writing, even if you don’t like the characters or events",0.60853111743927
comments discussing characters of the game,"Cool concept, lousy argument for the game being good.
Subjective and still not enough to live up to its predecessor or make me like Abby any more as a character.
Yeah that's neat. It would be a lot cooler if it happened in the cinematic universe we expected and wanted.
Abby will never be Joel.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I'm gonna argue with your good vs bad shit heads comment. In their world good and bad is basically staying alive or getting fucked. In the first game Joel is seen as badass because he doesn't trust anyone and will kill them in an instant if he feels he's in danger.
He killed all those people in the hospital because they would have killed Ellie who to him is basically his daughter. Most people here would say of course I'd let her get sacrificed for a chance at the cure but that's because you're sitting in your house playing a game. In reality his decision wasn't bad, it straddled on the grey line in relation to the world they live in.
In the second game he became an all around good guy and loved member of the community (as shown by all the flowers at his house). He decided to help this young lady getting attacked. h His guard was down because he became this soft person and it got him killed. It makes perfect sense story and character wise especially since he became happier and less cynical living in Jackson.
The whole good/bad dynamic isn't simple here. Just because they kill often doesn't make them bad but simply doing what they have to in order to stay alive. Like in this game when Ellie finishes off begging enemies...it doesn't make her evil, she just knows letting them go will get her killed down the line. Finishing off everyone guarantees her safety. Basically like Joel in the first game.
So if all you guys want is a good guy then your main character will likely have died in the first week of the outbreak because he wouldn't kill some guys breaking into his house to kill him...",0.6153287887573242

comments discussing characters of the game,"Gamers want games to be respected and seen as a legitimate form of art and storytelling (which they absolutely are), but reactions like the ones we have seen from the ""gaming"" community are so counter-productive for the mainstream to see games from that perspective.
I really enjoyed the game and I wish more people saw it and tried to understand the story and the writing like you did.
And that's a big part of it. I don't think anyone will understand the writing just by playing. You have to fucking think.
I love the line from Dunkey's review; ""Characters will do things you wont agree with and you'll have to turn your brain on and attempt to empathize with them"".
When you read a book, you don't just take everything at face value. You have to sit and go through different scenarios. You have to sometimes come up with explanations yourself as to why a character did something in order to understand that character more.
We study literature in our schools for this exact reason. Nobody would take such reductionist views from books like The Great Gatsby, Animal Farm, or 1984 as some players have from Last of Us Part II.
I think TLoU Part 2 is a big milestone in actually treating games as a form of literature in the mainstream.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Just finished playing this game — So now I can finally read all the discussions and watch reviews without spoilers.
I'm in the ""this game is a masterpiece"" camp so I may be biased but from what I can gather from most of the negative fan reviews I would hazard the guess that these boys aren't much of the ""reading"" types that value literature let alone understand complex character development and critical thinking. If these guys actually paid attention and enjoyed the typical books assigned in literature classes we would see a lot more thoughtful reviews (which does not mean you can't criticize the game) instead of ""I hate that they killed Joel! Abby bad! Foot stomp! Hmph!"" They probably also hated Romeo & Juliet because of the (spoiler alert) double suicide at the end and all the ""irrational"" decisions that led to that ending. Life isn't logical or rational, people are flawed and we all have the potential to make poor decisions in the heat of the moment. Heck, I still hold a grudge against a pizza place from 15 years ago that had an employee that was rude to me...

comments discussing characters of the game,"my one complaint was I wish they were harder on the trans and homophobia. Bf seemed to dance around it in a way that wouldn't offend anyone while GF was a little more pointed about it. There aren't ""two sides"" to homophobia and trans hate. It's not about agreeing with the lifestyle. If anyone doesn't like the game solely because they play as a woman, a gay woman, a buff woman, or because it has a trans character...you're a phobe and a dick and you shouldn't have a platform to spew hate under the guise of ""not agreeing with the lifestyle""
and for the reactionaries that are gonna jump and accuse me of saying people who don't like the game are phobes...no, that's not what I'm saying. Disliking the game is perfectly valid. Hating that Joel died..valid. Disliking the structure that forces you to play as the antagonist for a significant chuck...valid. the fucking need to pickup so much little shit...valid. There's lots of reasons, many I disagree with, but you know it's just a videogame and discussion is healthy, but plenty of valid reasons. There's criticism and disappointment. Then there's being a bigot. We should welcome EVERYONE that wants to talk about elements of the game or what people didn't like or what they would do different and we should SHUN everyone that disguises their toxic hate as ""reviews""
They shouldn't be afraid to take a strong stance anyway since the game is breaking all sorts of records in sales too. The hate is the minority, and PLUS if we successfully get this point across, more people who want to debate the game will feel comfortable knowing that we're welcome to listen non-hate stuff. If we weed out the bad guys from the discussion, people won't feel so defensive about not liking the game. Tolerating hate is not tolerance.

comments discussing characters of the game,"This is basically just a re-post of my thoughts on the game.
For me personally, I do think this game's story is quite bold and ambitious, but ultimately fails to be a cohesive, thought-provoking narrative as many claim to say it is. Regardless, I do respect this person's opinion and do not want to make it sound invalid, because it really isn't.
This is just my personal opinion.
There are just too many huge fundamental flaws in the game's story which I cannot overlook. Emotionally traumatizing your audience by brutally killing off a beloved character, who by the way, was one of the only TWO main characters who the players had such a deep emotional bond to, by the hands of a new character who we know nothing about, and then try to build our empathy for this new person is meant to be considered as good writing?
The game tries to do so much that and juggle so many characters and perspectives that it never manages to garner the same level of empathy from me for Abby as it did for Joel and Ellie. But that's normal human psychology; when we have spent 7 years (yup I replayed TLOU 1 a LOT), bonding with someone, sharing their experiences and pain, the level of empathy we have for this character will always exceed that of a newly introduced character who we know nothing about. It's very hard to try and make your new character just as lovable without dedicating an entire game to them, and giving them all that time to grow and evolve.
I can see why the game could be viewed as being something challenges its player in new and interesting ways such as testing our capacity for empathy and understanding of its 'complex and deep' plot and characters. But the difference between the first and second game though, is that the second game uses cheap and dirty tricks to ask us these questions and ""challenge"" our emotions, such as Ellie murdering dogs while Abby plays fetch with them, or how the Salt Lake crew is portrayed as being heinous in the opening act but then it is wildly juxtaposed by the representation of them being these kids that are good-natured and emotionally caring of one another. Basically, the game makes the player do all the heavy-lifting without itself bothering to present its themes, ideas, questions, moral and emotional dilemmas in an interesting, compelling and thought-provoking manner, providing little to no encouragement to the player to do so.
Ultimately, this game was just emotionally unsatisfying, that despite all the 'grand themes' it tries to convey, it ends up sounding contrived, and all the darkness and misery inflicted upon on its character and players just feels needless and purposeless.
Admittedly, the game's story IS quite bold and ambitious at what it tries to achieve and I can definitely appreciate that in a time in which many writers want to play it safe and just go down a well-trodden familiar path of crafting an easy, cash-grab narrative, but ultimately that risk doesn't payoff. When I ask myself the question: ""Was this a story that needed to be told?"" The answer is clear as day: Joel and Ellie's story should have ended with the first game.
I may be 100% wrong, but like I said this is just my opinion. I can definitely see why some people would call this game a masterpiece, but for me, its just not up there.",0.6058803796768188

But if you can't then this game was never for you. You don't have the right mentality to take this on. That's okay.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Well formatted analysis, and I can say that I can understand where the developers were coming from in the way they formatted the story. However, I don't agree that this ""experiment"" worked. Killing everyone as Ellie, and then having to play as Abby and her side, feels like a manipulative tactic from ND as ""You killed these guys, now for the next few hours feel bad about it"". I realize that the purpose of having the story formatted in such a way was ND saying ""You thought these people were monsters, but in reality, they were human, just as much as you."" This could have succeeded if they did a better job in humanizing Abby and her friends, but they didn't. I didn't care for any of Abby's friends, besides Lev and Yara. There are notes scattered throughout that you can collect, that build on their characters, but to me, that is lazy writing. Putting information that is crucial for their characterization in notes is just not the thing you want to do when you are creating a game where the characters are meant to be the meat of the narrative.
I don't hate this game, nor do I think it is bad or terrible, far from that. There are plenty of things to like about this game from the graphics to the voice acting. However, I don't view this game as a masterpiece, far from it. It is a solid 7/10 which could have been an 8 or low 9 if the story started with Abby, focusing on her side first, and then transitioning to Ellie. Again, I understand what ND was trying to accomplish, but I don't believe they portrayed it well, and they don't get points for attempting something new and failing to execute it properly, which I believe the reviewer doesn't agree with.",0.6437250375747681

comments discussing characters of the game,"Great video about it.
I just got finished watching a much more critical take and I just... can't understand it. A lot of the complaint and frustration boils down to...
OK, I get it. The villains have a backstory. All these people have backstories, they're all people too. Can we get back to the story I care about now??
Which is entirely, thoroughly missing the point. Abby's section doesn't exist in this game to ""drive home the point that Abby has a backstory and she had reasons for wanting to kill Joel""
Abby's section exists to make her the protagonist of her story. Not the only protagonist, Ellie still is too. But when you get to the theater, the desired narrative experience is not ""thank god, I'm back from this 10-hour flashback and ready to get back to the story"" ... It's that Ellie and Abby both have a story that they are the protagonist of, you are invested in both stories, and you want to see both of them continue.
And if you spend Abby's entire 10+ hour segment intentionally refusing to connect with it and just waiting to get back to playing Ellie, uh... Yeah, I guess I can see where you'd really dislike that section. But that seems willfully petulant.
OP's review is right on the money, and I love the phrasing of ""ego death"" when you get to the theater a second time. Because it really does feel like you're connected to both characters as ""protagonists,"" they are both ""you,"" and you are fighting against yourself.

Great game. Loving it. Definitely a high point in releases this year. Sets the bar for cinematic presentation, even makes RDR2 look amateur by comparison. Not blowing my socks off though.

comments discussing characters of the game,"The game suffers from this problem of being too bleak and depressing, I believe the creator of BoJack Horseman commented on the issue on ending each season on a sad note. It begins to lose its impact unless you're one upping it each time. I think the game failed to take this into account, you have a brutal and unnecessary death of a beloved character that happens an hour into the game. By comparison the ultra violence of encounters is almost - whatever, it's a backwards arms race of sad. You started the game with a nuke, only to go on and develop a glock, a bow and arrow, and some sticks with sharpened rocks.
The game tries way too hard to be this - The Road of video games. Wow look at this guys, look how hopeless and sad the world is. Yarra has arm bashed in, not bleak enough so might as well have it cut off. Tommy shot in the head, hmm we could do more though, let's have it that he survives and will now suffer with some pretty significant health issues going forward in this world. Almost there, how about we also have him go through a break up? Perfect. And was anyone else taken back by his reaction to Ellie towards the end? I let out an audible wow in disbelief, despite of what he's capable of along with his violent past he always struck me as someone kind of meek that wouldn't blow his top the way that he did. You promised me? Watchu talkin' bout you punk ass. Lets kill a pregnant ass woman, only develop her character after killing her off. We'll do the same thing to a dog. Anyone else find it absurd how she went on patrol? Lady you about to pop and okay with the possibility of a gunfight? Ellie continues on her quest for revenge, almost dies several times only to let her go because um, reasons? Okay but that isn't big sad enough so Dina and baby are gone, and also Ellie can no longer play guitar good. Something that would haunt her for the rest of her life being an ability that Joel taught her. And that ain't sad enough, here's her last interaction with Joel that left him in tears.
I find it baffling that this game got 10s around the board, 8s and even 9s I can understand. But there are significant issues with the writing, pacing and structure that all weaken the story which is perhaps the most important aspect when it comes to a Naughty Dog game. Not a game I see myself replaying anytime soon, the torture porn becomes tame early on and the game is just exhaustingly bleak. The story and gameplay aren't engaging enough to me personally, they really needed to balance out their tone with more light hearted moments to contrast this shitty world they inhabit.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I just don't get how so many reviewers are giving this 10/10. Don't get me wrong the game isn't actually terrible as some people claim (The people giving this around 1-2, or less, are quite frankly ridiculous in my opinion). But even though I found the game very good, it does have some serious flaws.
As has already been said over and over, everything but the story is a 10/10, or at least near to it. While in my opinion the gameplay isn't completely amazing or innovate, it's still fun and improves upon the first game (Although it's mostly fairly minor changes. If you had major complains with the first games gameplay, don't expect to enjoy it this time either). Otherwise the audio, graphics, immersion, accessibility, animations, acting - all top notch.
The story is obviously the weakest part, which is very disappointing considering the type of game this is. But even with flaws I found the story to be a serviceable and enjoyable 7. It managed to hook me from the very start and keep me hooked for the majority of the game. It lost me somewhat about halfway or two thirds of the way through, but then picked up again near the end.
Quite frankly the pacing is absolutely atrocious and hurts the overall narrative more than anything else. You play for over 12 hours having an absolute blast, it's not constantly perfect but you're so into the game at this point that you don't care. Everything is fresh and interesting with characters you know and love, you can't wait to see what happens next... And then suddenly it grinds to a halt for hours. Like you're starting the game over, but with a much less interesting story. A bunch of minor side quests with minor characters that it's hard to give a shit about. There are some moments sprinkled throughout those slow hours that are enjoyable, but the overall narrative is mostly uninteresting.
(Worst thing about this part of the game is that it occasionally gives you new skilltrees and/or weapons, but the story is such a drag at this point that unlocking new stuff literally feels like a setback, because you realize every unlock means it's going to drag on even further to make use of it.)
The game tries to make you care for all these side stories and new characters but due to the story structure you only get to know most of them in flashbacks or dialogue talking about past adventures. You don't get to see or experience enough with them. The ultimate fate for most of them is already known, which makes you completely apathetic to what happens to them and many tense moments fall flat.
Overall the game relies quite heavily on flashbacks, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, in the first half of the game they work fine; As the story is progressing, you get flashbacks throughout, but then return to the present and keep progressing. These flashbacks allows you to piece together some missing backstory and realizes why characters act the way they do.
However in the second half, you're already effectively in a massive flashback because it takes places simultaneously to the first half, and then you still get flashbacks going back even further. And some of these flashbacks are in the same locations with the same characters but at different times, confusing the narrative even further.",0.6056583523750305

I still kinda liked the story, but, I couldn't care less about Abbys side of things. Both her and Ellie had the same motivation for almost everything they did throughout the game but Ellie is the main character and of course I would pick her side. I get what they were trying to tell us with showing both sides, but this is a world where the solution to every dispute seems to be to kill the other person, and that is accepted by everyone. No one ever told Ellie that killing is wrong and that revenge wouldn't make her feel better, although I'm glad she seemed to realize that on her own in the end.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Gets a 7.5 or 8 from me.
I have two huge gripes with the Internet reaction. Gamer outrage is so immature and review bombing something because it took a narrative direction you dislike it just comically extreme.
The second is that taking a narrative direction you don't like isn't the same as bad writing.
My biggest gripe with the game is the pacing. It can be just abhorrently bad. And I see what they tried to do, but there were better ways without literally destroying the pacing of the game.
I don't think the early game scene so many people are angry about is ""unnecessary"", I think people are just fond of that character. If anything it was just realistic and people are too bogged down with the idea that every piece of writing is personally to affect them rather than be a plot point too.
The second half of the game is a gigantic risk that doesn't pay off.
But yeah, handing us upgrades and skill trees and stuff and then absolutely butchering the pacing of the game all of a sudden was just... Not a good move. Really killed the latter half of the game for me and it never fully recovered.",0.662761926651001

comments discussing characters of the game,"Just finished the game and it is fine all in all. I enjoyed playing it. I enjoyed having emotions towards the story.
It's a technical marvel. Best tech in a AAA-Game for sure.
Exploring is like Part 1. I like to take in the world while searching. But I can understand if some find it a bit tedious or grindy.
Combat is fantastic. Great Stealth-Action with a lot of room for playing around. It's fittingly brutal and gory. On lower difficulty it's easy to just run and gun but from medium upwards it's quite challenging and fun.
Storywise...it's fine. It has issues. The Pacing is kinda off. Not horrible. But just as the plot takes up speed we cut to a flashback. I don't quite mind the flashbacks in itself...they're just placed at weird moments so the plot grinds to a halt.
Joel's death is a believable inciting incident for Eliie's revenge-trip and that you play as Abby later is also an interesting idea. And Idea that could have worked better and her story could have profited from a more focused pacing.
Some decisions by characters are made more to drive the plot than coming natural. Some more than others. I had only one time where I was ""That doesn't fit"". That Tommy want Ellie to go after Abby again.
The End was okay. Bittersweet kinda. I think that Ellie actually wants to kill Abby is very strange. It's really well presented. Their fistfight at the shore is really great and brings the point across. But it feels wrong. Maybe that's the point? Don't know.
In general the story is veeeeeeery on the nose about the message of ""Revenge consumes you and turns you into a monster. And the circle of violence will continue and escalate if someone doesn't stop"".
I get why some folks don't like the game. But those 1/10 reviews and people calling is the worst game...that's bullshit. I mean some of this extreme hatred clearly come from folks who have a problem with LGBTQ stuff being so visible in a game. Some also have a problem with women in games who are not designed first to be fuckable in their eyes. But I guess the vast majority of those extreme haters just really really like hating the thing that was so hyped.
So...Conclusion: Is The Last of Us Part 2 this big Masterpiece that propels gaming into new spheres of art? Nope. Really not. Is it the worst AAA Game ever and destroys everything the first game did? Also Nope. It was Overhyped. Yes. But it's still a fine videogame with really fantastic tech. It's an 8/10. Sometimes slipping into 7 and other times reaching for that 9.",0.6267743110656738
comments discussing characters of the game,"Huh. I pretty much completely agree with you here. I thought the game was technically unbelievable... The graphics, the atmosphere, the facial animations, the brutal realistic combat. Fuck it felt so good to PLAY.
The out of character moment you mentioned is the first time I’ve seen someone mention it, it’s also exactly what I thought at the time. It felt really forced in my opinion. The whole final section leading up to the boat scene kinda felt forced to be honest... the scene itself was pretty good though.
I’ve said before the political backlash to this game has been completely bizarre. Abby’s appearance is literally a non-issue, neither is Ellie’s sexual orientation. The story though is fair ground for discussion, and I can absolutely see why some may not like it.",0.6521934270858765
comments discussing characters of the game,"Spoilers below ——
First off - I think people are having a hard time distancing themselves from the player character. It’s been interesting seeing people say they feel like they’re being personally blamed for the damage that they’re causing in the game but I feel like Ellie is making the moral decisions herself and I’m just here for the ride.
I really liked Ellie’s section of the game, even if I found the tone to be somewhat unsettling, and thought that Abby’s was somewhat less consistent (it really did feel like a B plot) but it still had some decent highs. The final part of the game managed to reel Ellie back in for me and let her make those right decisions, rather than scarring herself further.
In terms of gameplay, it’s really good if you liked the first one, even with just the implementation of being able to go prone and use the grass. The shooting has a lot of heft to it and you can feel the brutality of every melee strike. I am disappointed shivs reappear in Abby’s section (it seemed like a great QoL change during Ellie’s) along with having to completely rebuild a character and arsenal all over again.
I finished it tonight, I liked it. I’m sure my opinion will change over time and I’ll probably replay it again at the end of the year.",0.6575254201889038
comments discussing characters of the game,"First off - I think people are having a hard time distancing themselves from the player character.
I completely agree. I would say a big chunk of the criticism centres around a disconnect between the 'moral lesson' of the game and the game 'making' the player do horribly violent things.
I really feel like this criticism misses the mark. It's Ellie's story. The player is never asked to be a stand-in for Ellie. We're controlling her but it's such a narratively-driven game and Ellie as a character is so well-realised that I just never felt like I as the player was choosing to do all of these things. In the same way we are able to engage with a bad protagonist in a film or TV show, there should be no issue here with watching and enjoying seeing Ellie avenge Joel.
To the extent that the game is condemning the concept of revenge (which I don't even think accurately captures the story despite the 'revenge bad' memery that people are going with), it's condemning Ellie and Abby, not the player. Now, there's definitely scope to feel like the criticism of those two also applies to the player - for instance, if you got a ton of satisfaction from beating Nora's head in with a pipe then yeah the game's lesson will probably work well on you as the player (as it did with me).
But this is not the same as the overall thrust and crux of the game - I never got the sense that the ultimate objective of the game's narrative was to condemn the player for all the things they've done as Ellie. It is to condemn Ellie for all the things she's done as Ellie.",0.6520538926124573

What really, really irritates me is that embargo terms left reviewers unable to talk about concrete story beats, which is insane! No other publisher would just get a free pass for something like that. Having to review a story-driven game without mentioning the story is like reviewing DOOM without talking about the gameplay. I think it is sincerely disingenuous to give a game with such a deeply flawed narrative a 10/10 when that's what people are there for. I genuinely just don't know what a lot of these critics are thinking, unless they just have no concept of the craft of storytelling.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I loved this game. The story is a bit uneven and occasionally messy but overall I feel as if the narrative here is far more hit than miss and by the end of it all I was satisfied and ready for round two. The ending, in my opinion, kind of perfect. Tears were shed and heart attacks were had.
The gameplay here is tense, fluid, and oh so entertaining while still feeling incredibly brutal. Hearing enemies call to each other and their dogs by name when they go down was rough.
The acting was phenomenal as was the production quality overall. No surprise there.
The horror elements were great! The sequence in the hospital with the Rat King had me on edge the entire time. It was reminiscent of the sequence in Dead Space 2 with the Ishimura.
Overall, I enjoyed my time with these characters again. It isn't perfect and it doesn't quite match or surpass the original game, but it was a worthy successor nonetheless.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I went into the game without watching any trailers or ads and also avoided all of the leaks, I just knew there was some drama around it. I was not surprised at all that Joel died near the beginning. I assumed for years that the second game would revolve around his death in some way (or he’d already be dead when the game started). I watched some trailers and can see why some people are a bit upset about false advertising.
I am also seeing a lot of complaints about the pacing of the story, and I agreed at first, but I think it would have been worse if the story was told in order. I also actually really appreciated the flashbacks in between the days and thought they were a great break between “modern” events. If I did have one complaint it would be more gameplay related, it felt kind of bad to start from scratch when playing as Abby, but it makes sense that the two characters have different weapons, abilities and skill trees.
I am also seeing a lot of people basing the game off of some streamer who rushed through it. Personally, I think the game is something that needs to be experienced first hand (or on the couch with someone playing it). Rushing through is also a huge disservice to the environmental story telling. I thought there was a ton of immersion when you’d read letters in the world and then you’d kill a seemingly random soldier then hear their friends call out their name. There are also so many little stories for all of the environments you’re in, like seeing an electrocuted body near a generator then soon finding out that was the previous person living in the theatre.",0.6103807687759399

comments discussing characters of the game,"I finished the game over the weekend
The amount of negativity across the internet is really strange, especially the number of opinions stating, ""I haven't played/finished the game BUT...""
And the trophy completion percentage definitely mirrors that. It's probably higher now, but as of Sunday, the percentage for the ""Finish The Game"" trophy was around 1.8% making the sheer amount of commentary about how the game sucks quite suspicious.
Personally, I think the Last of Us Part 2 is incredible. I'm not a critic and do I get anything out of saying this (except for an inbox full of hate). I'm a long-time fan of Part 1 and was convinced for the longest time that Joel and Ellie didn't need a sequel. I honestly did not want these characters to come back because I was convinced there wasn't much more story to tell. And I'm happy to admit after a lot of hesitancy that I was wrong.
I love the characters, how they change throughout the story. And some of the unexpected reveals throughout the game were some of the biggest highlights for me.
All that being said, I can understand why the game wouldn't be necessarily enjoyable to play for a lot of people. The gameplay is quite stressful and is highly focused on desperate stealth or frantic firefights. Every combat encounter is so nail-bitingly tense that after some very long sequences, it felt like my heart was going to explode.
The game is also very bleak, with a very dark and violent outlook on this world. It's centered on, moreso than any other video game, the horrors of an apocalyptic world and a poisonous cycle of revenge and hate. If you aren't prepared for that, I can see why someone would come away from the game feeling upset, unfulfilled, and probably depressed.
But, the experience is just unlike anything I've had in a video game. The motion capture, animation, and acting seriously runs circles around any other game in history and the engrossing, beautiful and horrible environments are still top notch.
People can go ahead and call it trash (likely for no other reason than they disagree with some of the game's character choices), but for me it'll go down as one of the best gaming experiences in history.",0.6268765330314636

And marketing it as Ellies Story and then playing so much as Abby is a very real flaw that I think kicks the game in at a 9/10 TOPS
But reading through all these top comments, and tone and language they use, seems like people are just ragging on the game because they dont like that Joel died.
And since that's too obvious of a 'salty' opinion they are blowing other minor flaws out of proportion
Joel's death was fine. A little tropey and expected, buy what isn't tropey...? It makes sense that the daughter of the doctor Joel killed would want revenge - and having been a hopeful firefly who lost her pack, she had nothing to lose.
My main issue with playing as Abby, after getting past the issue of the game being billed as Ellies Journey, is the same issue I had with the first games Winter segment
You spend all game building up your character with upgrades and loot, just for it to be taken away - and when you finally return to that character, you only have a handful of encounters left before the game is over.
Ultimately, gameplay should be king when discussing a video game, even one that sets out to be a movie quality narrative. Anyone rating this well made game under an 8, or acting like some 10s are unwarranted while games like MGSV and BotW got tons of 10s from the industry, are just salty kids who like to hate on popular stuff - and reading through peoples reasonings, I'd wager didnt even play the game themselves but are basing their opinions of leaks and the opinions of others.",0.6738688945770264

And now for an extremely hot take: I think Abby is a better character than Ellie within the context of this game. She's got better morals, and she has way more reasons to be mad at Ellie than Ellie has reasons to be mad at her. I found her infinitely more likable than Ellie within the context of TLOU2 because TLOU2 just kinda beats you over the head with how shitty Ellie is. Personally, I would have liked if the entire game focused on Abby without involving Joel or Ellie at all and just made her the central character of her own story independent of any of the stuff that happened in the first game. If the game's story would have been about the conflict between the WLF and the Scars and how there's good and bad on both sides and did more to develop Owen, Mel, Isaac, Lev, etc. within their own story, I think the game would have been better for it.

Can I even go so far as to say that I liked the protagonist switch 15 hours in, and that it didn't ""destroy the game's legacy and undo everything TLOU stood for"" like a very angry DM I got an hour ago told me it did?
Is ""TLOU 2"" perfect? No. But it's certainly not a 0 out of 10.
Also, this idea that it was ""out of character"" for Joel to get ambushed by Abby and her cohorts is so obviously parroted by people who only watched the leaked cut-scenes, it's infuriating. In the actual gameplay, Abby saves Joel's life multiple times, and vice versa. An element of trust was clearly established.
Plus, Tommy and Joel are in the middle of a blizzard, taking shelter. Yes, it's with people they just met, but they trusted Abby. And before you say ""Joel would never do that"" he literally did that with Sam and Henry in the first game.
To hear the Internet tell it, Joel just strolled up to the gates of an armed compound full of strangers and shouted ""Doot doot doo -- I'm Joel. Oh, no -- is that a girl with golf club??"" In actuality, Joel immediately realized he was in a bad situation, but got surrounded by TEN fucking people.
Yes, he gave his name, but Abby already knew who he was, because Tommy told her during the aforementioned infected fight. Also, again -- Joel trusted Abby because she saved his life. She only learned who Joel was from Tommy after it was too later to do anything about it. That's when she hatched the plan to lure him back to the compound, after previously gaining his trust (inadvertently).
Also, Joel isn't fucking superman. He's a haunted by what he's done, and the game goes out its way to show that he's acting irrational about it: the fight at the bar, wandering into a blizzard, a million other flashbacks, etc. Plus, in the first scene, he's got a guitar conspicuously hanging where his rifle hung the entirety of the original game -- same position, same angle. If there's a less subtle way of indicating he's lost his edge that isn't some character saying outright, ""Golly Gee, Joel -- you've certainly lost your mistrust of strangers living around all these good people in Jackson,"" I'd LOVE to hear it!
Finally, the sheer amout of butthurt over Abby being the one to kill Joel is astounding. She's clearly a capable fighter. She's the first player character to kill infected, and she saves Joel's ass by bludgeoning a dozen fungal zombies with a crowbar.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I pretty much agree with all of this. The farm house scenes with deeply traumatised ellie trying to live a normal family life were some of the hardest hitting in the game imo. I was expecting the game to end there, and so when I had to slog through storming the resort I was kind of just wishing it was already over. I'd probably just have preferred a long cut scene to play out the final conclusion to the story. I do like the ending however. The scene where Ellie blames joel for robbing her of something that would have made her life ""mean something"" makes her losing her family all the heavier.",0.6002224683761597

comments discussing characters of the game,"I’ll avoid spoilers.
I completed it over the weekend and I think its a masterpiece. I’m astonished that people are having such negative reactions to it. I guess a lot of die hard fans just don’t want to accept what happens in the game, which I understand. But I really hope that those fans can look past their initial reactions and really see what this game achieves, because I truly think it is peerless in its craft. If you come at it with an open mind, an open heart and a strong stomach, you’ll be enriched.
It’s not a story about revenge, or a pandering morality play on violence - it’s about trauma. How it lingers in you, how it can define and destroy both alliances and enemies, how it is rationalised (“revenge”, “justice”), how it refuses to leave one’s body, and how deeply dehumanising it is.
The ending gave me that same sick, cold feeling in my stomach as the first game’s ending, where I hated what was happening, but couldn’t truly condemn it because I understood where it was coming from. I think fans who can’t get past their initial reaction...they’re missing out. This is a story told with a level of emotional maturity and honesty you rarely see, except in perhaps the first game.
But try telling that to anyone who has had their heart broken by the game and has already made their mind up...people like Ellie.",0.6025716066360474

Its a poor choice that just leads to unsatisfying returns on your investment into these characters.
It reminds me of my issue with the telltale walking dead games when you play as another character whose not Clem. All the choices you make, everything you do revolves around helping Clem even if it doesn't make sense for ""your"" character.

comments discussing characters of the game,"The whole rage outburst just all came down to the pacing of the opening sequence. I don't even think Joel's death was the key reason. It's just how the story was unfold. I really couldn't believe they did such a bad job (or lack thereof) on establishing all the new characters in the opening sequence because all of the characters at the start just don't really connect to the player or Ellie at all (I made a video that went into details on what's wrong with the introduction of new characters), which is really bad for the game's first impression. Especially when there are so many great games on the market and how Naughty Dog is known for making master piece time and time again, people will just judge the game prematurely.
That being said, the gameplay is really polished and I enjoyed the game quite a bit, if not a little bit too long and outstayed its welcome. The plot gets a lot better once you're like 6-8 hours into the game. Just imagine if they did a better job at pacing the story and introducing all of the characters, this game would have been a really solid action-adventure game.
""Would have been"" is a good conclusion for this game, solid but has a lot of wasted potential of being yet another Naughty Dog masterpiece.",0.6049553155899048

Anyway, I'm will never touch a game from Druckmann again. I said that after TLoU already but this time it's real.
That experience was like a movie ( I saw the Devil comes to mind ) with a hypnotic story...but you never want to watch again.

I feel like we're heading towards some sort of major turning point when it comes to crunch culture, like some sort of major controversy where we find out Rockstar has been holding its employees' families hostage during the production of GTA 6.
As far as the story goes I'm not sure if I'd be a fan were I to sit down and play it. I'm really not big on the whole ""remember this totally insignificant character? Yeah well you killed them and now their kid is out for revenge"" trope. Especially since you literally could not progress the game without killing that scientist in the ending of the first game, so it's sort of like you're being punished for completing the game.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Fantastic write up!
As someone who's seen the game played all the way through I think it's a decent game with some noticeable issues (none of which are the existence of lgbt people, brown people, or women who dare to have biceps). Certainly not 10/10 material but not a dumpster fire like band-wagoners would have you believe either.
It's unfortunate that the review bombing and transphobia/homophobia (seriously, don't go to /thelastofus2. the rampant hatred spewed at minorities is ridiculous) make having genuine discussions about the game's actual issues difficult. Especially in regards to the irl poor treatment of employees at naughty dog.
On top of crunch I've heard from several different people that the developers were made to use actual images/videos of mutilated bodies as reference in the pursuit of realism with the game's violence (though I can't provide concrete sources for the rumors). Regardless, as tech increasingly approaches more realistic depictions I think this will become a more urgent problem in the gaming industry, with people having to embrace subject matter than can inflict real world harm to the psyche in pursuit of art or a paycheck. Hope anyone damaged by unethical work practices recovers well.",0.6478312015533447
comments discussing characters of the game,"As someone who is vaguely aware of video game drama normally but completely missed the boat this time, kudos. What a rollercoaster ride of a read that was. At first I thought it was going to be about bigots, then I thought it was going to be about the ethics of pushing employees too hard, but it ended up being about a game that critics ""love"" (although really--critics will give any game a 9.5 out of 10 if they think it's decent) and players love to hate--go figure.",0.6345465779304504
comments discussing characters of the game,"This drama isn’t less than two weeks old so much as on-going for years. The review bomb is due to all the factors I set forth - The LGBT representation incited homo/transphobics to hate on the game, some rejected the game finding this representation not having been done properly, some bombed it due to the leaks which showed a game many were unhappy with for one reason or another, some may still have had residual feelings against Naughty Dog due to the expose that came out, some may have had hate against Druckmamm for the Hennig departure - which IS a thing - I mean, this post is a list for the storm of bad things that occurred around this game’s development. Yes it’s two sides yelling at each other, but there’s no one factor to cause it, its the lot of them. And yes, many of the reviews didn’t finish the game, that’s the point of a review bomb - people who don’t play a game give it low ratings for external reasoning.
Does that make more sense, or do you just generally disagree and feel that for a more completed sense of the drama, people should wait? Because if anything, an update post can be done when more drama occurs with this as extended background.",0.6168439388275146

comments discussing characters of the game,"but it’s going to be very hard to differentiate those genuine criticisms from bad faith actors who are seething at “forced diversity.” Everybody just needs to play the game or read the leaks (as I did) and form their opinion on the narrative for themselves.
It actually is easy to differentiate. Notice how OP doesn't even mention the actual industry reviews, which are absolutely glowing. Instead claiming ""Many applaud the technical side of the game from the graphics to the sound design, while noting the narrative as a downside to the game."" Which is a claim not backed up by nearly all the reviews seen here who seem to adore the story.

Are the opinions of professional critics relevant ever? Fuck no. They're clowns with very close relationships with publishers. Games journalists are punchlines for a reason.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Thank you for this writeup by the way. It's obvious you put real time and work into compiling and writing all of this.
That quote explains a lot. It is a divisive concept. That games don't need to be fun. As game makers strive to make an artistic impact I think the debate will become even more prominent. I mean in Film, Requiem for a Dream, and Moonlight are both beautiful artistic achievements. Neither of them could really be described as fun. Also though neither of them ask for thirty hours of active participation.
If people prefer to see something uplifting, prefer to be excited, prefer to be entertained that's perfectly fair. If someone wants to spend their time at the movies watching Fast and the Furious instead of Parasite there shouldn't be shame in that.

My favorites were the ones that thought Joel had acted out of character by revealing his name to Abby’s group.(He never does this. It was his brother Tommy who revealed their names and you literally only need to play a half hour into the game to find this out) And the ones who couldn’t “buy” Abby being so ripped in the apocalypse with its scarce resources (you literally spend 20 minutes in the game slowly walking through Abby’s literal football field size training area and see her woof down one of the thousands of pounds of meats she has access to.)",0.6066721677780151

comments discussing characters of the game,"I agree with you. The game’s relationship and characters gave me everything I needed from Ellie and Dina. I never found Dina to be a flat character nor did I need a slow burn to their relationship.
I honestly don’t like Ellie or Dina in the show nearly as much as I do the original versions. They are both more mature in the game; Dina is more of a grounding presence who can still be rebellious and have fun. They both have their snarky moments but they are believable balanced out. I loved the sense that we begin the game just as their slow orbit finally collided, but that happens to be when everything turns to shit. I also think the linear structure of the show is to the narrative’s detriment.

comments discussing characters of the game,"hey, can't deny that. This was the first episode that I felt like, while i was watching it at least, I kind of disassociated from myself as the person who had played the game and was like ""this was fun"". I think after 3 episodes of being kind of annoyed it was getting to a point where I either had to give in or stop watching it, and i love TLOU too much for the latter.
I totally get what you mean though about it being well-performed. That's been a constant struggle with this show for me. A great example is the line from the final episode of S1, the hilariously on the nose, tell us Joel's whole character arc in a single line, ""It wasn't time that did it"" conversation. From a writing/storytelling perspective, god i hate that line. But the interaction between Bella and Pedro is just portrayed so beautifully that it kind of tricks me in the moment. If I examine it at all, I go back to hating it, but every time i see that clip, it draws me in.
I think that overall, that's probably the greatest magic trick the show is doing. They've hired such amazing actors, who have this backbone of such a great narrative with occasionally great writing (like everything with Isaac this episode was wonderful. The subtlety of him talking about how dehumanizing ""voters"" is to him casually calling a Seraphite a ""scar"" to their face was really excellent i thought), that it can kind of draw you in at times, and forget that it coulda been better.
Buuuuut then you remember.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I’m so with you. I’m at the point where I’m recommending people watch a playthrough of the game instead of the show. I’m so put off by the drama they’re adding in. I feel like part of what hits so hard in the end of the game when Ellie leaves for Santa Barbara is because Dina has been, absolutely NOTHING but supportive to Ellie in this crazy revenge scheme. Like Dina and Ellie are so solid up until that point (minus the pregnancy scare fight). So it hits extra hard when Ellie needs to leave.
I see a lot of people cite how homophobic the world probably is as reasoning for Dina’s struggle, and I kind of think that’s bullshit. Dina didn’t grow up in a country where being queer is politicized. Why would homophobia be the default in a small town where there’s larger threats like raiders and flesh-hungry fungus? Don’t they have bigger things to worry about?
It’s frustrating because part 2 is a game I have glowingly praised for its excellent lgbt representation. Not only do we have multiple lgbt characters, but they are well written and real and for ONCE the gay character’s plot didn’t center around “omg, idk am i gay??” And now it’s being butchered. feels like such a disservice to bi women to portray Dina like this.",0.6217454075813293
comments discussing characters of the game,"Yeah, agreed. Your first point is exactly my main thesis here, and Dina being so certain and forthright of her attraction to Ellie in the game was such a breath of fresh air for depiction of ESPECIALLY a bi woman.
I don't necessarily agree that there wouldn't still be room for homophobia, I think we've found in real life that people will always find room in their hearts for hate, in fact when things get bad, people often get even more awful to marginalized groups, but what I really don't buy is that Dina would care. Her nonchalant reaction during the dance to Seth, with her flippant ""sorry"", I think speaks volumes about how little Dina cares about what other people think, so for her to be like ""i have to hide my sexuality"" feels really off base, if that is indeed what the writers are going for.",0.6195914149284363
comments discussing characters of the game,"yeah, it's so disappointing, bc especially as you mentioned - Bella and Isabella on their own are killing it. but the way they are being written is just... a bummer.
and I know what you mean, it just seems like people are like ""well OBVIOUSLY gay marriage wasn't legal in 2003 so everybody's probably homophobic 🙄"", like...I'm not buying that? Gay people still existed. Especially in a small town where community is emphasized, nobody is spending all their time on facebook reading anti-gay propaganda. Why couldn't Jackson have queer adults and leaders? In the game it feels like Seth is just a bad apple that said the wrong thing, but Maria & Joel protects them. Nobody else says anything. I don't get the sense that anybody else has a problem with queerness. Just seems like a needless and hurtful thing to add to an adaptation that already doesn't pull punches. It's giving ""idk how to write gay people so let's make it about them being insecure about their gayness"".

comments discussing characters of the game,"I full on agree with everything you're saying here.

It's so frustrating that they decided to go this route with the relationship. Like, I can clearly see what they're going for, but I still just don't like it.
Not every queer story has to be a slow burn, self-discovery or coming out story. And that's what I appreciated so much about the game. It allowed the story just be a story with gay characters, without trying to downplay or hide the gayness.
Instead of generic self-discovery I would have loved if the story would've just focused on their actual relationship dynamic and who knows even expanded it in ways that aren't so easy to do in video games.

comments discussing characters of the game,"yeah, big agrees all around, but especially Craig's takes on Ellie. His take after the first episode, saying she was ""activated"" by seeing Joel's violence, like she liked it. Don't get me wrong, Ellie definitely idolizes Joel. But her descent in pt2 doesn't mean anything if she's already a violent sociopath just waiting for the opportunity to enact it. If she was, she wouldn't be so traumatized after David (though her trauma after David isn't only amount the violence she does here), or Nora, or Mel (i was going to say ""and Owen"" but i don't think the Owen of it all really bothered her that much).
My guess for that is that they're going to lean into the idea of thinking she's like Joel, but when push comes to shove, she's just not. That is definitely something touched on in the game, most notably when she fails horribly to interrogate Mel and Owen using the ""Miller Brothers Method"", but again, that moment hits because we've been watching Ellie tumble into apathy and extreme violence the whole game, which is a departure from how affected by it she is in the first one, and clearly also what her friends think of her.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Per my fics: thank you so much, that's awful kind of you to say.
And i absolutely respect your differing opinions on these, and if i'm completely honest, they're probably a little more fair than i was being, or at least giving the writers more credit than i am. I think the only thing I would say is, like with Dina and Joel's relationship, or Dina still going for Ellie, I guess I would have just liked to have actually seen that a bit more (and maybe we will with Dina and Ellie there in Seattle). I think that sure, the way you're reading Dina and Joel can be inferred, but taken at face value (which is always dangerous and risks being accused of not having media literacy), he's calling Dina his nickname for Ellie. He's watching the movies with her he watched with Ellie in the games. Etc etc. Things like that made it feel to me like replacement rather than a different kind of relationship.
I fully admit though that I have a strong bias here, and even though it's an adaptation and deserves to get to make its changes, i was really hoping their relationship would be one of the things that emerged completely untouched, and i'm having trouble letting go of that now that it's clear that's not what's happening.
Also, really great insight into the different personalities of the writers and how that's coming through to how they write the characters. A+ work just on your whole comment in general, i'd happily read a long analysis from you about the show/game.",0.6785238981246948

My friend's mom called me kiddo so I see it as like that, but I get how it can be jarring when we're so used to that language and these little things associated with them be exclusively about their individual relationship.
I'll have to wait to watch the whole season before I think of doing that kind of analysis, but it's nice to know my perspective has some value. My perspecitve being I had a front seat to watching my two wild 19 year old co-workers fall in love and share the details with me individually. They were young and dumb about it (I was 29), but it moved me still to the point of writing a song about them. That is who Ellie and Dina on the show remind me of and perhaps why I'm soft on them.
Well, as game fans we automatically come into the show with bias. The thing that can shake me up at times is the soundtrack. It's still beautifully utilized on the show, but whenever I hear it for the first time on the show it feels weird to me because I'm so used to musical themes being attached to specific characters or different parts of the story from the game.
Anyways, thanks for the thoughtful reply!",0.6284576654434204
comments discussing characters of the game,"I agree with you for the most part and you make some really good points about the difference between game Dellie and show Dellie.
But I want to highlight something else here. For better or worse Neil Druckmann really likes his ambiguity and the games reflect that. Some plot points we only find out in hindsight, characters say things they don't mean and generally speaking a lot of things are open to interpretation.
My biggest gripe is 3 month time jump and what that means for Ellie's story. In the game she and Dina leave so soon that Ellie has no time to develop PTSD and that's why it hits her so hard when she finally comes to rest after Seattle. Her PTSD is one of the main reasons that she is faced with the impossible choice of leaving Dina.
So when the show makes this time jump where is her PTSD? She should be showing symptoms by now. In the game Ellie never realized just how damaged she was until it was almost too late. And the existence of a therapist in Jackson kinda worries me that they will reframe Ellie's story to one where she is actively doing the wrong thing by declining professional help when the point of the game was that there was no help available.
And as you mentioned the love Ellie and Dina had for each other is kind of the shining light that is untouched by Ellie's trauma exactly because it predated the trauma. In the show this relationship starts with a traumatized Ellie which is not a good direction honestly.",0.6318945288658142

comments discussing characters of the game,"First of all, I wanted to say your point of view was very interesting and beautifully written.
Also I would love to read your fanfic!!! What's the title?
I absolutely understand your perspective, I also think that Ellie and Dina in the game are presented as more mature and better equipped to handle different situations, which is reflected in their relationship. It is far more grounded at this stage in the story compared to the show. They def feel like ride or die very quickly. The fact that they get together on the day of Joel's death makes for a heart wrenching contrast, she gains this beautiful, loving relationship, while she goes through the worst loss of her life. I also appreciate your comment about it being a factor in their relationship, this sense of guilt that haunts her, I couldn't have worded it better if I tried.
However I feel more hopeful than you towards their relationship in the show. I think it's a very realistic representation of how people their age navigate through those romantic feelings. With changes of the timeline I believe they can still build a solid foundation for their relationship, it doesn't have to happen right this moment, it just has to be strong and convincing before Ellie's departure to Santa Barbara. I think in a TV show the creators have more time to explore their feelings and show us their connection compared to the game.
In the game they wanted to establish their relationship before they arrive to Seattle, so that we (as gamers) can be thrown into the action and focus on the gameplay. Later they only have time for the cutscenes where characters comment on certain events of the story and plan their next steps, so they didn't have as much time for exposition as they have in a show. I think the creators want to have fun with this new freedom that the show provides. Also there's a question of how many scenes Ellie and Dina will have in Season 3, which probably will favor Abby's story more, but it would be smart to throw some scenes to keep the audience engaged in their story. So maybe that's also a reason for this ""slow burn"".",0.639752984046936
comments discussing characters of the game,"Yes more of this content and discourse please. Actual in depth, considered, and well-intentioned discussion. I think you and I are on a similar level when it comes to how much this story means to us, and it’s a shame to have to tip-toe through the minefield of bad faith, ‘am I the only one..’ (the answer is always no), straight up hate filled, shallow, and all together immature posts around the show. So yea. More please?
I’ve been thinking about setting up a sub for story nerds like us to go deep on thing. Almost like a reddit book club for fans of the last of us, to share conversations on theme, character, structure, etc. like all the good goo that writers use to hook us in, leaving the dopamine seeking, grenade-dropping posts at the door.
Anyway. In response about Dina.
I also see what you mean about how they are thinning out her intentions to be somewhat more impulsive. Almost like the dog from up. She can be loyal, but shes also prone to distraction. But there’s also a case to be made that they are working towards conflict that seals their relationship.
Yes the approach is here taking its time, which I’m hopeful will pay off.
Because by the time the farmhouse rolls around, Dina needs to be locked in as the one person who loves Ellie so much, that the PTSD is something she is always willing to help carry. I mention this specifically as someone with PTSD and a partner who does the same for me.
I initially played part 2 in 2021 and it absolutely wrecked me. But after having a breakdown last year, I played it again. And suddenly saw Dina for who she really is. Because everything she says in the kitchen, I know my partner feels.
From the outset, after Joel’s death, game Dina is there knowing Ellie needs help and goes out of her way to do it. Which is my partner to a Tee.
So yeah it would hurt a lot if they changed her. But I don’t think they will change her destination, just her journey. I think that any conflict between them (whether it be the relationship to Joel or not) will only serve to bring them closer, and nail that devotion to Ellie down in the show audience’s mind.
This story doesn’t have hero’s. Except for Dina.
Having said that, I could just be high on copium and denial right now. But I’m in it for the ride.",0.6128008961677551

comments discussing characters of the game,"this IS the same whiskeytango! That's so incredibly touching of you to say.
I agree wholeheartedly with your whole post. The show is really leaning into them being just teens, and I think that feels like a misunderstanding of the world of the game. In the game, sure, they are the dictionary definition of teenagers, but they are adults. Young adults sure, but still adults. They have both been through so much in their time. Dina was 10 when she first killed, Ellie 14, and they've done a lot of it since. They exist in a world where, even within the safety of Jackson, they do not get to be teens like people right now do. They are a step away from being child soldiers, being out on patrol to protect the town from the time they're at least 16, but probably younger going by how quickly Ellie writes about trying to get on group patrol.
All of that to say, because they feel more adult, their relationship also feels more adult. There's a feeling of far higher stakes and intimacy than of a teenage crush. For some reason, I imagine maybe because Mazin has kids around their age, that they're now being written like they're kids, kids from our time period and circumstances, and man... it's deflating to the weight of their characters.
Actually honored to read your words again.
That's crazy nice of you to say. I don't want this to turn into me doing a ton of self-advertising, but I do want to say that since I haven't written anything but those two fics, i've decided that I want them to be the best they possibly can be, so in the last couple months I've been working with a professional editor friend of mine to do kind of a ""remastered"" version of them. Been adding new chapters, punching up the writing, and just trying to overall heighten them. I suspect I'll be done with it in the next couple months, and then am going to update the stories on ao3, so i guess just watch that space.
You really made my day, it's such an incredible feeling for people to still be commenting and saying such nice things about those stories 5 years later.",0.6602951288223267
comments discussing characters of the game,"I feel like you're maybe too close to the fantasy of the relationship per your fan fiction and love for it to take an objective look at the changes. One line in your post stuck out to me, that this show version of Dina and Ellie is based on trauma bonding and a transitory crush, not a genuine, deep love - I have to call BS on that.
In the game, they're (best?) friends who share a kiss at a dance, make out the next day, and then Joel is killed. A couple of weeks later, now in a relationship, they go out on the road to find Abby.
In the show, they're best friends, share a kiss at a dance, and then the next day Joel is killed. Three months later, after Dina has apparently visited Ellie many times at the hospital, they go out on the road to find Abby -- not yet in a relationship, but still as best friends with something else forming.
I don't know that a brand-new relationship rises to the level of ""genuine, deep love"" -- or if it does, that that love is SO much bigger and grander and meaningful than the relationship they have in the show. I mean, in the game, they did not have a romantic history before the kiss. Assuming the show has them fall in love and be partners, I don't really find it to be that off the mark that the show takes its time getting there -- not the three months between the kiss / Joel's death and them leaving for Seattle and not the time in Seattle it takes them to grow closer and develop something romantic. It's for sure not the same, but I don't find it to be some huge missed opportunity -- in fact, I like that show-only viewers get a little more time with the two of them courting each other and having each other's back before taking the next step. I don't necessarily think the game rushes it, per se, but the game version of their relationship grows very quickly and mostly unseen -- and is absolutely the result of the trauma bonding you claim not to like as much, given they go from flirty friends making out on a couch to die-hard-ride-or-die within a matter of weeks after Joel's death.",0.6000587940216064
comments discussing characters of the game,"""I feel like you're maybe too close to the fantasy of the relationship per your fan fiction and love for it to take an objective look at the changes.""
You didn't have to read a bitch like that, god damn.
In all seriousness, yeah, obviously I am close to the situation and can get in my own head about it, easy to admit that.
I do think your view of it doesn't take into account Ellie's journal entries going back to when she arrived in Jackson. They can certainly be read as just friendly, but something just as simple as the ellipsis while writing about the paper crowns with ""its... pretty great"", and like ""i feel like Dina is avoiding me"" in the entry about her relationship with Cat, and Ellie's drawings of Dina in her journal and her garage (you know who else Ellie has a pinned up self-done drawing of in her garage? No one. Just Dina, unless you count Shimmer, a Giraffe, and Daniela Star.), definitely speaks to me of long time mutual attraction. Everything there is a specific choice meant for us to be able to put together that they aren't just a couple of besties embarking on a new relationship. It's been a long time coming.
Edit: just wanted to add here, Ellie does draws a lot of people in her journal she isn't attracted to, but i mean, damn, look at the way she drew Dina, compared to Joel and Tommy on the facing page. The pose she chose, the smile. She draws her lips 7 times. Seven. Times. Just like everything else, this isn't an idle little addition from the creators of the game. This was a choice to include.
Also, there's more subtle changes, mostly just in the demeanors of the two characters in the game vs the show. They seem more mature than their age in the game, and their flirtations and interactions likewise feel more grownup, which leads to a feeling of a more grownup, mature love and relationship than how it's being portrayed in the show. And there's nothing wrong with portraying two 19 year old characters as teenagers with dopey crushes, I love watching most of their interactions on the show because it feels flirty and like how i had crushes at that age, but having said that, to me it doesn't match the tone of the relationship in the game, even if it is potentially more realistic.
That's my interpretation of that at least.
Another edit: Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to say there is no trauma bonding in their game relationship, cause yeah of course there is. What i mean to say is that in the game the trauma bonding happens after their relationship has started (with the aforementioned years of quiet longing), and in the show it's nearly all post the traumatic event, with no allusion to this being a long time feeling between them. To me, that's a big difference on what the relationship is built on.
I do appreciate your comment though and your take. I am fully aware that not everyone has the same view on their relationship, even in game as i do, and it helps me cool out about about how it's being handled in the show to have someone such as yourself essentially tell me to go outside for a bit.",0.6264412999153137

Some critics argue that Ellie’s revenge should feel justified because Joel was murdered. But Abby’s inclusion in the story complicates this simplistic view.
Yet Abby's revenge is totally presented as justified, and worse, she never even acknowledges that she's worse than Joel in what she did to Ellie (""We let you live and you wasted it!""), nor does she ever realize that Ellie has the same right and justification for her revenge journey, since Abby gets all the way to the end still believing that right and justification is true of her and hers (which seems also to be believed by the writers, and apparently by you).
By living her pain, experiencing her motivations, and witnessing her growth, the player is forced to reckon with the humanity of someone they had every reason to hate. 
This was not my nor others' experience of Abby at all, though. I experienced her selfish lack of concern for anyone except herself, which is especially magnified in how she dismisses Mel's reaction and withdrawal from her upon return to Seattle, and further highlighted by her not even having noticed Owen does the same thing and has been avoiding everyone at the stadium, too. Her selfishness continues right to the end.
Then her complete lack of humanity is continuously depicted from her cluelessly discussing killing Scar kids who ""deserved it"" to a very pregnant Mel, to her wandering aimlessly through her WLF tasks seeking relief solely for her needs, to her distracting Owen from calling her out on her crap by succumbing to lust with him in the midst of his drunken existential crisis, to her selfish needs also being her stated motivation for suddenly helping the two Scars to lighten her own load (it's not for them, she doesn't know them), to her then once again breaking Owen's heart by dumping him after he so fully attaches to her he's ready to dump Mel, to her complete lack of concern for Lev's needs after he lost his family and village (she drags him further into her need for revenge and ignores his entirely - but then so do the writers and the sequel defenders) and finally dragging him to her desired goal (the FFs) thus leading him from one cult unopposed to making child soldiers right back into another (nearly getting him killed in the process). What a gal! (Mel's words were pretty prophetic in the conversation where she calls Abby a POS).
Finally, she has literally very little growth since she's exactly the same person at the end as she was in the beginning. Growth would require an actual redemption arc rather than a fake one which acts like her helping Scars atones for what she did to Ellie (or Joel). It doesn't. Redemption and growth actually requires people to recognize and own their shortcomings and evil acts and show remorse and consideration for those they've harmed. Yet Ellie and Tommy keep showing up and she never once has any insight into how she harmed them the same (and worse) that Joel harmed her. Helping unrelated people when those she's harmed keep showing up and she never realizes anything of that is not growth nor does it redeem her for those harms she actually committed against Joel (who saved her life), Tommy (who also saved her and helped return her to her friends) and finally Ellie who screamed and begged her to stop and she ignored her completely and never owns the damage she caused to Ellie at all. Worse, she never even had a simple word of thanks when Ellie cut her from that pole and allowed her to save Lev. Where's this growth you're talking about? Growth would look something like her finally talking at the end to try and diffuse the situation with some authentic sharing of something that might actually help Ellie (e.g., telling her Joel killed her own father, sharing with her that her own revenge didn't solve her grief problems or even sharing that her attachment to Lev has helped her finally understand exactly how Joel felt: that for him the FFs were his Rattlers and she can no longer blame him for what he did). Any or all of those would be growth and redemption, yet the writers purposely and unnaturally withhold that from her and from Ellie.
So, sorry your elaborate depiction of her journey as Shakespearean and full of forgiveness and redemption misses all the ways it is not anything like that at all as I delineate above. You are also utterly ignoring the fact she didn't learn that violence isn't the answer because instead of finding any other way to deal with Ellie at the boats, she agrees to continue the violence. We clearly see Ellie's committed to a fair fight, so Abby refusing to fight in favor of talking is actually required to display the growth you attribute to her without it actually existing, and was a possibility since Ellie wanted a fair fight. If she's so gained ""a hard-earned understanding: forgiveness is the only way to end the cycle of pain,"" then her failure to demonstrate that at the end is a huge sign your interpretation falls apart or she'd have displayed it in any of a number of ways, but she just doesn't. The writers won't let her. That was a purposeful choice on their part because they didn't want her redeemed in a conventional way. Instead they tried (and actually wrongly believe they succeeded) by using other means that actually only fake redemption with the Scars (who she never harmed anyway, while those she harmed get nothing from her), and through the bad karma of the Rattlers (which is solely bad luck and nothing to do with those she harmed, either). They did all that to subvert expectations, making up their own redemption rules that fall far short, and ended up subverting the actual redemption.",0.6111787557601929
comments discussing characters of the game,"If you're interested, I also have a post about my experience with Part I. Personally, I love reading posts like this, people sharing how they experienced the story, especially when their opinions or emotional responses are completely different from mine. So if you've written something similar, please share it. I'd love to read it!
For Part II, I wanted to do things a bit differently. While playing, I kept a file where I wrote down some thoughts, reactions, things I shouted at the screen, stuff like that. I thought about sharing that file but it's really freaking long and I don't know who would actually want to read the entire thing… I mean, I would, but I'm kind of weird like that. I'll be quoting parts of the file, hopefully, you'll find it interesting, or at least entertaining :)
Even with my notes in front of me I know I'll miss things, I'm reading through them now and there's so much random nonsense. It's kind of funny, I wrote down tons of thoughts and reactions, but there's zero context. No chapter titles, no locations, nothing.
It took me 15 days to finish the game, way longer than it should've. I didn't check my final playtime, but the last time I played as Abby I was at 23 hours so I'd guess around 24-25 in total. I could've finished it in a couple of days but there were sections that were just SO scary I'd freeze up. I would sit there staring at a door I was too scared to open, then end up scrolling Instagram for an hour and suddenly it's 1 AM and I have to sleep. That's how I ended up only playing only 1 or 2 hours per day. 
Just something to keep in mind while reading, quotes in italic ""Like this"", are my own thoughts that I wrote down while playing, quotes in bold ""Like this"" are direct quotes from the characters. Anyway, enjoy :)
DAY 1 - Jackson
https://preview.redd.it/1xzj5z93vg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=69bc717fad12e2dc296b5e14e4beaf0c694011f2
Prologue
Joel's conversation with Tommy about the hospital, those cinematics hit way harder this time. Maybe because in Part I I was too focused on the gameplay and the shock of the ending, but hearing it all laid out again really landed emotionally.
Right after, we step outside into this absolutely stunning place. Jackson already looked great in Part I, but now, in golden hour lighting? Gorgeous. Of course I took some screenshots. I have to say, Part II was so intense and plot-heavy I ended up taking way fewer than I did in the first game.
Back in Ellie's room, the tension between her and Joel is obvious, and it's understandable after what happened in Salt Lake City. Still, the moment ends on a really sweet note. Joel playing and singing for her, then giving her the guitar. That got me emotional.
Waking Up
""4 YEARS LATER"". We wake up as Ellie, and I did not expect that kind of time jump, ""Omg look at you!! All grown up, she's soo cuteee"".
We're introduced to Jesse through a pretty awkward convo:
""She kissed me"", and I'm like ""WHAT??""
""We break up for a week and you make a move on my girl?"", ""Excuse me?? Your girl?? What is happening?? Oh he's mad"".
""I'm messing with you"", ""so.. we're cool? Okay"".
We find out Ellie has a journal, and I love it. Such a great addition, you get a glimpse into what she's really thinking, the stuff she doesn't say out loud. It adds so much depth.
As we walk through town, we run into the old asshole who made trouble the other night, whatever, and then we finally meet Dina. She's gorgeous. The conversation about what happened last night is a little awkward, but then we team up and absolutely destroy those kids in the snowball fight. 10/10 moment.
The Overlook
We meet two new characters, Abby and Owen, and my immediate reaction is: ""Who the hell is she?"" and ""Damn, she's buff"".
It was already pretty clear to me that these people weren't up to anything good, and I had really mixed feelings about it, ""I don't want to play as the bad guys"".
We move forward, clear a couple areas, try out the new mechanics, cool, please give me Ellie back.
https://preview.redd.it/iigr6y06vg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bd94856c8d177b6d98f30b4ba96552485072a80
Patrol
The game answered my prayers, we're back as Ellie, out on patrol with Dina. Loved this part. There's a bunch of great interactions between them, and we even find out Joel's into old action movies, who would've guessed? I really love how these little details keep adding layers to the characters. When we reach the supermarket and Dina says, ""Spores, masks on"" and it suddenly hits me, these people have no idea Ellie is immune.
After the chaos in the supermarket we lose Dina in the storm and I was genuinely terrified, thinking something way worse was coming. Luckily, it wasn't. We find shelter, the whole scene in the grow room? Easily top 5 Part II moments. Weed and sesbian lex? Let's goo.
DAY 2 - Jackson:
The Horde
We're back as Abby, ""Ugh"". That horde of infected was terrifying, I wasn't expecting something like that at all. I was sprinting for my life, absolutely screaming, ""WHA- WHO’S- JOEL??? TOMMY?? HOLY SHIT"", stress levels through the roof.
Back to Ellie and Dina, still enjoying themselves. And Ellie's tattoo?? I want it. I need it. At the time, I thought it was wild that Ellie just casually told Dina about the bite, just like I expected Dina didn't believe her. Then Jesse showed up with bad news and just like that, the fun was over.
Back to chaos, the three are still running from the horde, they make it inside the chalet, and things start to feel... off.
Tommy introduces himself and Joel to Abby's group, when Joel says his name? You could feel the tension. It was like the whole room froze, I felt like I was actually there.
This part... this part was something. Back when I wrote my post about Part I, I thought I had it all figured out, ""It's going to be this amazing story about Ellie growing up with Joel, going on cool, dangerous, emotional adventures, some setbacks for sure, I mean, it's a post-apocalyptic world, but nothing too wild"", was I wrong.
Abby shoots Joel in the leg and I start screaming ""EEEEEHHH?? WHAT THE FUUUCKK???!?!"", ""OH MY GOD, HIS LEG, HIS LEG IS COMPLETELY FUCKED UP"", ""WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?! THEY JUST SAVED YOUR ASS"" I couldn't stop. I was yelling the whole time. Abby steps back, and I think, ""Okay… okay. She's going to torture him, interrogate him. She wants something. By the time she's done, Ellie and the others will be here. They'll save him. It's going to be fine"".
Back to Ellie, she's racing toward the chalet, yelling Joel and Tommy's names And I'm yelling at her like, ""Girl, LOWER YOUR FUCKING VOICE"".
She gets inside, heads downstairs, opens the door. And there's Joel. On the ground. Covered in blood. Barely conscious.
I start screaming again, ""SHOOT THAT FUCKING BITCH"", Ellie gets tackled, they are holding her down and she's screaming the exact same things I am, ""YOU'RE GONNA FUCKING DIE"", ""I'M GONNA KILL YOU"", and so on.
The scene is overwhelming. My heart's pounding. I'm panicking.
Owen says to Abby, ""You're done"", and I think, ""Okay... Joel's still alive, he's hurt, bad, but he's going to make it. We've been through worse, we'll get through this, we always do, right? Right, Joel?""
Abby looks down at him, she tightens her grip on the golf club and me and Ellie are begging the same exact thing, ""No. No no no. Please stop. Please"".
She strikes him one final time.
I stop screaming. I just let out one long gasp, then silence. I stared at the screen in total disbelief. Not even crying yet, just pure shock. This felt like the kind of thing that happens at the end of a story, not just a couple hours in. Everything I thought this game would be was shattered. I paused the game.
The next scene, Ellie sitting on her bed staring into nothing, that was literally me, just sitting there, silent, for 20 minutes, trying to process what just happened. ""This can't be real, right? They'll save him, rush him back to Jackson, treat him..."" Then a knock at Ellie's door, ""JOEL??"" How naive. No. It's Tommy. And he brought food. That's when it hit me.
Joel's dead.
He's actually fucking dead.
https://preview.redd.it/9vgkge58vg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4e2e7165a9267b54b5887ee79db611877e85a12
Packing Up
This part hit me hard. ""The Horde"" had me filled with rage more than anything else, I just wanted to shoot Abby right then and there, I was completely shaken and furious. But this? When I saw Joel's grave it all changed. I immediately started tearing up, fuck, I'm actually crying again while writing this. Seeing all the flowers and letters left on his doorstep? God.
When Ellie went to open the door, her hand trembling... I know that feeling all too well. Once inside I didn't rush anything, I wanted to take it all in, I interacted with every object, explored every room. Upstairs, when she found his watch and pistol I just whispered ""Aww :("", I saw the photo of Joel and young Ellie and immediately started tearing up again, and then the closet... she picked up one of Joel's jacket and smelled it. That was it, I completely lost it, everything I had been holding in burst out in that one moment.
After giving myself a bit of time I kept going, I was so mad at Tommy, of course he'd go after them, it's his damn brother, all that bs he told me before was just to keep me in Jackson.
Today was too much. I couldn't keep playing. I closed the game.
I know what you're thinking, ""Damn girl, how long is this post gonna be?"" don't worry, I'm not diving this deep into every chapter. I just felt like Chapter 1 deserved a bit of extra attention. To me it's by far the heaviest and most important part of the game, and it all happens before the story even really begins.
DAY 3/5 - Seattle Day 1
https://preview.redd.it/17jtzt7avg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2078ff377e3c77d8b762d4daf8c4c57720dd9be7
This part opens up like an open world, which was a cool surprise. We track someone from Abby's group to a TV station, but she's already dead. Ellie finds a photo of the people who killed Joel, now we got faces and names to go after, nice
https://preview.redd.it/6v3tk5edvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=61871117e468d6e3c4cf2474fcd87eff14a422e5
Then the tunnels happen, and it's pure chaos. Ellie's mask breaks, Dina panics, and for a second I thought we were losing her. We make it to the theater, and just as things start to settle Dina drops the bomb: ""I think I'm pregnant"" Ellie: ""What"" Me: ""WHAAAT?!"" Dina: ""Don't worry, it's not yours"", ""YEAH NO SHIT WHAT ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT!?!""
https://preview.redd.it/es6bzx1evg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ad691423ee5888d132e0e5005ce49a50fa5e50
Ellie's birthday flashback, wow. Easily one of the sweetest, most heartwarming moments in the entire game. I was completely floored, like, ""NO WAY, IT'S ACTUALLY A FREAKING DINOSAUR"" I started tearing up almost instantly. The whole sequence is just pure joy, it's beautiful, it's funny. Of course it made me miss Joel so much more, this was such an incredible surprise, I didn't expect something like this at all. It's really nice that they didn't just write Joel out of the story, but kept him alive through these memories. And the scene inside the capsule? Absolute perfection.
DAY 6/9 - Seattle Day 2
https://preview.redd.it/sfzd6n9fvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a244793a2bc83b3af0e5922a6463b4d8b697bdd
Hillcrest was intense, I really disliked being alone and the abundance of stalkers made it even more terrifying. Jesse's unexpected arrival was a huge relief, unfortunately it didn't last very long
https://preview.redd.it/kzasxqqgvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6c4d6822921d0db4522d41a01e1c6c2c7f651e9
The ""Finding Strings"" flashback, I just love these moments and always get overwhelmed with excitement, even though this one was a bit scary, I'll take any second I can get with Joel. Ultimately it did end on a somewhat funny / sweet moment.
Not much to say about the Seraphites, weird cult of fanatics, not a fan. As awful as everything with the Seraphites was in Day 2, it doesn't even come close to what goes down between Ellie and Nora.
https://preview.redd.it/ex3t95mjvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a8955914f8668a351cda4398aae9b737bdef6a7
This is where we really start to see Ellie lose herself, rage and revenge are eating her alive. The way she kills Nora is brutal, and when she returns to the theater... her hands are trembling, she's in shock. That bathroom scene right after wrecked me, I was holding back tears. There's something so raw about seeing someone in that state… and the shot of her back just adds to the weight of it all, covered in bruises and cuts... it hit hard.
I was waiting for the game to bring up the whole hospital thing, and they did. That flashback was rough, Ellie confirmed her suspicions, at first I didn't really get why she was so mad, Joel saved her. I eventually (sort of) understood her reasons later on.
DAY 10 - Seattle Day 3/The Park
https://preview.redd.it/2x67ewflvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b2ad93e472fd29d755ca476a0dd41d1f3ae4b1
Day 3 opens with a shot of Ellie’s back and the sight feels overwhelming as much as the other day, we get to spend some time with Jesse, he's a solid guy and I really liked his character, unfortunately once again we get to see how Ellie is slowly losing herself more and more, prioritising her revenge on Abby over everything else, the two split and Ellie goes once again on a solo mission to find Abby
https://preview.redd.it/aru7dgfqvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc035a8bb5f6e96eaeb684099188ea68cf2631d3
Infiltration (I know I said I wasn’t going to deep dive into other chapters but I feel like this one is important, sorry :>, future me, also the next one, sorry again, hey it's future me again, just a heads up it will happen a couple more times especially near the end, sorry not sorry I love yapping)
For the first time I really thought we were nearing the end of the game. I was convinced we'd find Abby at the aquarium, everything felt like it was leading up to that, the atmosphere, the heavy storm, Ellie struggling to keep it together. But nope, Abby's not there. Instead, Ellie ends up killing Mel and Owen, and when she realizes Mel was pregnant she just breaks down, completely overwhelmed. Tommy shows up with Jesse, I was so relieved to see Tommy, ""My god, finally"".
I never could've predicted what was coming next. Tommy and Jesse are planning the route back to Jackson, for a brief moment things feel calm, there's this light-hearted exchange between Jesse and Tommy, you catch yourself smiling and forgetting about Abby, forgetting all the darkness for just a second.
Then, a noise. My mind immediately went to Abby ""I bet it’s fucking Abby, she must've tracked us down"" Ellie and Jesse rush to check on Tommy, Jesse gets shot in the face. I let out this short but loud scream, like I was right there and saw it happen with my own eyes. It was sudden, brutal, completely out of nowhere.
And I was right. It's Abby. She's got a gun to Tommy's head, my heart's racing, I have no idea what's about to happen. ""Is she going to kill him too?"" Abby turns the gun on Ellie and the screen goes black.
At that point in the game, we still had no idea who Abby really was or why she wanted Joel dead. We knew nothing. So in that moment I was fully on Ellie's side, every kill felt justified, and my hatred for Abby was growing right alongside hers. I wanted her dead more than anything, from my notes: ""Listen, I don't give a fuck how bad this is going to be, there's nothing joel could have done to this bitch that would make me feel bad for her"".
Tracking Lesson
This chapter is absolutely essential. No one will ever convince me that anyone who played the game and reached this point didn't scream out loud or at least let out a gasp. I personally went with, hold on… let me check my notes… ah yes:
""Doc..? [about a 2 second pause] AAAEEEEUUUGGGH (that’s my interpretation of a loud gasp) HE’S THE DOC- THE DOCTOR, THE SURGEON, THE ONE THAT GOT KILLED BY JOEL, HOLY SHIT IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW"". 
We get to see the hospital scene from a totally different angle, and it turns out things weren't as black and white as they seemed. Marlene's decision wasn't as simple or heartless as I used to think back in Part I. I remember hating her, feeling completely betrayed and manipulated. In one of my previous posts I wrote something like: ""[…] Fuck you, Marlene. I get it, ""One over many"", screw that. They're all going to die one way or another, so who cares if humanity goes out? [...]"". That's easy to say when you've only seen one side of the story. Just for the record, if I had to make the choice again, I'd save Ellie every single time, even if it meant killing Abby's dad.
That said, did he deserve to die? Absolutely not, but it was a consequence of its own actions. Okay, but Abby not only didn't deserve to get her father killed, she also didn't do anything that would lead to the father's dead, so was her rage and actions against Joel justified? Joel made a choice driven by love, selfish, but deeply human. Abby was fueled by grief and needed someone to blame, Ellie wanted to make sense of a loss that shattered her. They're both stuck in this cycle of revenge, thinking it will bring them peace, but all it does is destroy more of who they are. They're both right in their own way, and both wrong in how they deal with it.  
DAY 11/13 - Seattle Day 1/2/3:
I'll try to keep these three chapters as brief as I can, with a bit more detail once I get to ""The Confrontation"".
At the time I really hated that the game was forcing us to play as Abby. It pissed me off because I knew exactly what they were trying to do, make us understand her, see things from her side, and eventually feel empathy for her. But I didn't want that, I was still full of anger, ""What, now I'm just supposed to play as the villain? As the one who killed Joel? No way"". All I wanted was to get back to the theater and see something like Dina coming up from behind and putting a bullet in Abby's head.
After hearing that Owen may have killed a WLF soldier to save a Seraphite, Abby sets out to find him. She gets captured by Seraphites and is saved by Yara and Lev. They battle through infected and WLF, forming a bond built on fragile trust. Abby eventually finds Owen at the aquarium, and after a tense and emotional night they reconnect intimately.
Abby goes back to Yara and Lev after that nightmare and finds Yara in critical condition, so she brings them to the aquarium and Mel agrees to do surgery if they can get supplies from the hospital. The Hotel part was already terrifying, but nothing compared to ""Ground Zero"". At the hospital Abby gets caught but Nora helps her sneak into the basement. I can't explain how fucking terrifying and stressful this section was, I kept putting it off, scrolling through Instagram, and it ultimately took me 2-3 hours. The Rat King? I was screaming, barely looking with one eye half open. Scariest moment in the series, hands down
https://preview.redd.it/s21ipm0tvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c7248ab78c31553c17c52e271c6409a11faf99f
By Day 3 I had come to understand and accept Abby, and I was genuinely enjoying playing as her. If I'm not mistaken she has three dreams in the Firefly hospital, and for the first time she wakes from a peaceful one of her father, it was really sweet. She was on the path to redemption, with Yara and Lev helping shape her into someone new. On the way to the marina, Abby joins Manny to deal with a sniper, I was shocked when it turned out to be Tommy, just moments before I was rooting for Abby and Manny to take that fucker down, and suddenly I didn't know how to feel. A perfect example of how easy it is to pick a side without the full picture. Tommy kills Manny, Abby nearly dies, and Yara saves her and they get to the Seraphite island to find Lev.
They push through during the WLF invasion and find Lev devastated after killing his mother in self-defense, It was such an intense scene, how could a mother treat her own child like that? The three attempt to flee but are caught by Isaac, when Abby refuses to surrender Lev, Yara sacrifices herself to save them. I went into this mission already expecting that one of them wouldn't make it, but I didn't think it would happen like that. I really feel for Yara, she was a true fighter.
Abby and Lev escape the island and get back to the aquarium, only to find Mel and Owen, dead. Abby is shattered. Here we find out exactly how Abby was able to track Ellie down, when Ellie left with Tommy and Jesse, she left her map on the ground, Lev found it and gave it to Abby. One small thing that got overlooked and changed everything.
What if Ellie hadn't left the map behind? I know it's kind of a pointless question, we could say the same about anything. Like, what if she looked left instead of right, saw a butterfly, followed it, and then missed a trap and died in an explosion, game over. Still, I do think that if she hadn't left the map, she and the others probably would've headed back to Jackson like they were planning to, and I doubt Abby would've risked following them there. Then again, who knows if Ellie would've actually gone back. It's just a never-ending loop of what ifs. Anyway, I'm rambling, sorry.
The Confrontation
The anticipation for this chapter was insane. I'd been playing for three days and couldn't stop thinking about what was waiting back at the theatre. I kept imagining hundreds of different outcomes, and every time I thought about it the scenario in my head got worse. As I walked in as Abby and started heading downstairs my heart was pounding, as I already knew Abby surprises Tommy from behind, Ellie and Jesse burst in, Jesse gets shot... and then? I had no idea. All those outcomes I had imagined? Completely vanished, suddenly my mind was blank, I didn't know what to expect anymore.
Tommy jumps on Abby, Lev shoots him in the leg, and Abby shoots him in the head, I'm fucking screaming. My first thought was, well, that's it for Tommy, actually, here's a quick entry from my notes:
""NOOOOO WAHT THE FUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKKKKK WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUCK, WHY AM I STILL PLAYING AS THIS FUCKING BITCH GIVE ME ELLIE, ELLIE DONT YOU DARE FUCKING DIE TOO""
As you can probably guess in that moment everything I had come to appreciate and understand about Abby just went straight out the window. While chasing Ellie all I wanted was to get shot, I didn't even try to shoot back once. It wasn't until I realized that if I wanted to finish the game I had to follow where the story was taking me, so I gave in and went along with it.
The first ""hide and seek"" part wasn't too hard, but every time a cutscene showed them fighting I was just SCREAMING, hoping Ellie would finally get the upper hand, only for her to get beaten down again and again. 
The floor collapses and the second phase of this whole ""hide and seek"" (I hate calling it hide and seek, is there a better name for this sequence?) thing begins, way harder this time. I honestly lost count of how many times I died. Ellie is insanely fast and her movements are so unpredictable, there's basically no way to hit her if you're even slightly in front of her, she can dodge bottles and because that wasn't enough she starts using traps and I'm seriously sweating, just trying to not get caught because I'd made it this far and didn't want to mess up and start all over again.
The moment Abby starts choking Ellie had me jumping up and down on my chair screaming, this time it was way too close. Ellie manages to pull out her knife and stab Abby in the leg, the gameplay keeps going. 
The whole time I'm thinking, what's it gonna be? Who's coming out on top? Is the game really making me kill Ellie?? Then another cutscene, Abby breaks Ellie's arm, that's it, there's no way Ellie's winning, she's just getting punched over and over and I'm yelling, and then ""OEEEAAEEHH (excited scream) DINAAAA, YEAAAAH CUT HER UP!"", Lev shoots Dina in the shoulder, ""FUUUUUUCK"", now I'm panicking for Dina, she's getting her head smashed, Abby pulls out her knife and I'm losing it, I thought for sure Dina was done for. It would've made sense, Ellie went after everyone Abby loved and now Abby's doing the same, right? 
""She's pregnant"", and Abby replies ""Good"". I'm screaming even louder, but thankfully Lev steps in, if it weren't for him Abby would've 100% slit Dina's throat. ""Don't ever let me see you again"".
I'm thinking this must be it, now that they're even there's nothing else worth going after. And the screen, once again, goes black.
""WEELL???""
Still Day 13 - The Farm
https://preview.redd.it/p5j3xmcuvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a1a11677d60160aa6b010191d2eeceb9a986d6c
Suddenly we're looking at this house in the middle of a beautiful landscape. ""ELLIE!?... Joel's watch :( … THE BABY!?!? Wait, how much time has passed? Dina was only a few weeks pregnant in Seattle, so… about 9 months for the pregnancy, and now the baby has a full head of hair and can sit up on his own… maybe 6 months old? So like, a year and 3 months? Damn… are we actually getting a happy ending??""
On the way to the tractor I saw the sheeps and realized this was literally Dina's dream, she talked about it back in Seattle, I think at the synagogue? Anyway, the whole thing felt unreal, after spending the last two weeks going through the most horrific things imaginable, suddenly there's this calm… it doesn't feel right, it feels like a dream. When Ellie goes to round up the sheep I peeped the inside of the barn and my first thought was, ""The barn looks way to scary, I swear if this is actually a dream that turns into a nightmare or something I’m uninstalling on the spot"" Reality was, this was much, much worse than a nightmare.
What follows is incredibly real, raw, and terrifying. As Ellie goes near the lamb one of the shovels falls and triggers a quick flash of Joel. She follows the lamb outside but a gust of wind slams the barn door shut leaving Ellie in total darkness, she immediately breaks down, slipping into a full on PTSD-triggered flashback, reliving what happened at the chalet. Dina rushes in, and we're met with this soul-crushing image of Ellie on the ground, sobbing, her face showing pure terror and the disorientation afterwards.
I just rewatched that scene to make sure I had everything in the right order because I tend to mix things up sometimes, and I couldn't help but cry again. These are the kinds of scenes that really hit me the hardest, I just can't handle watching someone in that much emotional and mental pain.
In the next scene Ellie comes back from hunting and there's a horse outside the house, I honestly didn't even notice it at first and I'm only mentioning it now after rewatching that part to help me write this and I just realized that I completely missed it, most likely because I was still processing everything that had just happened moments before. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting anyone to be inside the house, let alone Tommy. I doubt anyone was, I mean, unless I missed some clues somewhere, the guy got shot in the fucking head. So yeah, seeing him alive was a total surprise, and a good one at first, I was really happy to see him again.
But that feeling didn't last long. As soon as he said, ""I got something to show you"" something felt off, and then he pulled out that damn map, I just sat there in disbelief while he talked about Abby and everything else, and now I'm […]
Sorry, future me here, I just realized how many times in this post I've said that I felt exactly like Ellie, at the exact same moments she did. And I can't help but think that's probably a deliberate effect of the brilliant writing behind this story. It's like every time you're feeling something, the character is too, and they manage to pull that off every single time. It's honestly crazy.
Anyway, […] going from confused to straight-up angry, like, what the fuck is wrong with him? Why would he bring this up again? Did the bullet mess with his brain or something? Those were the thoughts running through my head. But then I looked at Ellie's face and my anger started shifting into fear. She's thinking about it, of course she is. She never stopped, how could she?
Tommy's last two comments before leaving were completely uncalled for, but I get where they're coming from (not that it makes them okay). His leg is fucked, he's lost an eye, he can't go after Abby himself anymore, that promise Ellie made? He held onto that, for months. Tommy's no different from Ellie, or even Abby for that matter (well, Abby was actually able to move on by now but you get what I’m trying to say), they're all carrying unimaginable loss, all trying to cope in whatever way they can, even if it's the wrong way and in the end they're all chasing the same thing: peace.
Next up we get a shot of Dina and JJ in bed. As the camera slowly pulls back, it becomes clear that someone is missing… and there's this sound of wind, like a door or window was left open. I both hate and love how they mess with us in scenes like this. Of course, my first thought was, ""No she fucking didn't"" (as in, Ellie already left). But no, she's still here, just sitting silently on the bed.
This entire sequence, just like the start of the chapter feels unreal, like a dream, actually a nightmare this time, I totally expected an infected to just grab me through a window and then she'd suddenly wake up in a panic, all sweaty or something.
I realized I could go into Ellie's room, but before triggering anything I wanted to walk around the house. She stumbles on her guitar, her playing always hits me emotionally, every single time. Then I finally went upstairs and into her room, she pulls out her journal from the box. We get a look at the most recent entries and find out she's been having those flashbacks again and again…
""When will this stop?"",
""I don't want to talk about it. It's just gonna hurt."",
""I feel so guilty."",
""My skin hurts."",
""Can I leave it all behind?"".
Suddenly we're back in Jackson. At first I wasn't sure if this was future or past Ellie but then I noticed her longer hair, and once they showed her face, it was clear this was past Ellie. Then Jesse appears on screen, which was such a pleasant surprise, I really, really liked him as a character and honestly feel like he didn't get enough screen time.
Ellie says something I can't quite remember word for word, but it was along the lines of ""You'll get back together in two weeks"" referring to Jesse and Dina, and that's when it finally clicked, this was the night Dina kisses Ellie. I was so excited, it was a really awkward, funny, sweet moment… until that old dickhead showed up. I genuinely felt bad for Joel in that moment and the whole situation instantly turned painfully uncomfortable.
We're back at the farm, and we see Ellie packing... I already know what this means, and I'm begging to be wrong, begging for her to stay. Dina knows it too, it's obvious.
""I have to finish it"", the look on Dina's face says it all. It's the same expression I had, I was hoping Ellie wouldn't say something like that.
""You don't owe Tommy anything.""
""It's not about Tommy...""
""I don't sleep. I don't eat. I'm... I'm not like you, Dina."", probably referring to how Dina (at least to her eyes), managed to move on, or at least cope, with everything, including Jesse. Ellie even touches on that in her journal...
""Stay.""
""I can't.""
""We've got a family. She doesn't get to be more important than that.""
Unfortunately Ellie hasn't come to that realization yet, and I can't blame her. After everything she's been through, how could she possibly think clearly? She's not driven by logic at this point, she's driven by pain, by loss, by everything she's had to carry since that day in the chalet. It's not even about revenge anymore, she just wants the pain to stop, and the only way she sees that happening is by getting Abby out of her head, once and for all. And to her the only way to do that is to finish what she started. What other option does she see? There's no peace, no closure, not until she tries. Even if it costs her everything. At least that's how I see it.
Now I'm completely thrown off. When this chapter started, I genuinely thought that was it, Ellie and Dina, finally getting to live the quiet life they deserve. But suddenly we're back on Abby's trail and I'm just thinking, seriously? How much longer is this going to drag on? It feels like the third time this cycle starts over and each time I'm convinced it's going to end with Ellie dead.
Today was really something. The chapter was short but really intense, I couldn't bring myself to keep going, I just saved the game and closed it. I spent the rest of the day lying in bed. Call it pathetic if you want, I don't care. When you spend nearly a month @ (between Part I and Part II), living in this world, walking in the shoes of this one character, it gets to you. You see this character grow, go through moments of light and darkness (mostly darkness), and it becomes impossible not to get attached, to the point where they're all you can think about.
@ Yes, almost a full month. I'm slow, my first playthrough took around 17 or 18 hours and almost a week to finish because it was my first time playing a horror game and I couldn't handle more than an hour or two a day, plus, I have this bad habit of gaming only at night, which didn't help. And as you can see, Part II is taking me twice as long.
Day 14/15 - Santa Barbara/The Farm Epilogue
https://preview.redd.it/jl6jcncwvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=822714045c4beceaa830fa0970689de31b33db2e
Unrelated to the chapter, but I just ran this whole post through a character count tool and I'm already over 32k which is kind of insane, I've got just under 8k characters left before hitting Reddit's 40k limit, and honestly I have no idea how I can expect anyone to read all of this. If you made it this far, you're an absolute legend, I seriously appreciate you and I hope you found the post at least a little entertaining, or that some of my thoughts gave you something interesting to think about. Fun fact: I nominated Ellie exactly 69 times. Anyway, back to the chapter.
Santa Barbara
[Had to erase this part because I exceeded the Reddit character limit and I honestly don't know what else to delete, you can find it in the comments]
One of the Rattlers nearly gets bit by the clicker, blah blah blah, you know what happens, I'm running out of characters (quite embarrassing actually, can you believe that this post is almost as long as Reddit allows?) and want to get to the point already. When we reach the beach I was stuck for a bit, I didn't know what to do, then I heard coughing and looked up and  realized I could interact with someone tied to the cross and, holy shit it's Abby. She's completely unrecognizable, she looks absolutely wrecked, malnourished, her hair is different.I interact with her and she just says, ""It's you."" I can't even imagine what's going through her mind, probably thought she was about to get stabbed.
But Ellie cuts her down, Abby helps Lev down, then looks back at Ellie, and kind of invites her along, saying there are boats. So now I'm sitting there thinking, ""WELL??? SO WHAT NOW WE JUST GO HOME?""
They each go to their boats, and… Ellie sees Joel again and remembers what made her come here in the first place. She grabs Abby and throws her into the water, Abby doesn't want to fight but Ellie pulls her knife on Lev and I completely lose it. I'm yelling at the screen (as usual), begging her not to go through with it, Abby agrees to fight and it's brutal. By this point I had come to terms with my anger toward Abby that was reignited during the theatre part. I genuinely wanted both of them to live, but more than anything I wanted Ellie to get what she came for so yeah I guess in a way I also indirectly wanted Abby dead

As Ellie's drowning Abby, she gets another flashback of Joel, fuck I'm tearing up again, Jesus, sorry. This time it's different, he's sitting on the patio, playing his guitar. Smiling. Peaceful. Ellie lets Abby go.
The Farm Epilogue
We're back at the farm and the house already looks abandoned from the outside, then it hit me, Ellie killed that fat Rattler who said Abby had been taken months ago. I don't know exactly how much time passed between Tommy tracking her and Abby being captured but it couldn't have been too long, factor in the trip to Santa Barbara, which is what, two or three states away? All by foot? And then back, it had to be at least a couple of months. Dina must have been alone all that time, she clearly knew where Ellie was going and must've had an idea of how long it might take, but I doubt she stayed much longer after Ellie left. At that point it wasn't about holding onto hope that she'd come back, Ellie had made her choice, and Dina understandably didn't take it well.
So yeah, I wasn't surprised to find the house empty, and neither was Ellie by the looks of it. I checked every room just in case Dina had left a note or something, but I wasn't really expecting to find anything. Ellie's room was almost untouched.
Ellie picks up her guitar one more time. Until that moment it hadn't even crossed my mind that she’s wouldn't be able to play anymore because she had lost two fingers on her fretting hand. Ellie strums a few broken notes, looking completely devastated.
Then we're back with Joel, on the patio, that same flashback she had during the fight with Abby. I was crying like hell, both when I played it and now writing this. The conversation goes from ""coffee, nice"" to ""I should've died in that hospital"" in an instant. I mentioned earlier in this post that I didn't really understand why she would think that. But I think I do now, she believed that was her purpose, even if she didn't know she was going to die at the time, she knows now, and still, she feels like that should have been her fate. Maybe because that idea that her life only had meaning if it was sacrificed, was planted in her from a very young age. It's easy to instill certain beliefs in children, and if those thoughts aren't addressed, especially something that significant, they can carry them into adulthood and continue to believe them. Back at the farm, the ending couldn't be more heartbreaking, Ellie sets the guitar down and walks away, the screen turns back one final time.
Conclusions
There's a lot I would like to talk about but I've actually got a couple hundreds of characters left so I'll just get this one point across: Everyone calling Ellie a cold-blooded murderer is wrong. ""But she killed hundreds of WLF, Seraphites, blah blah blah"" No. You did that, not Ellie. That's the gameplay part, realistically she would've gone through most of it without killing anyone, and the people she does kill are those who leave her no choice. The only exception is Nora, but even then it's not like Ellie walks away unaffected, she was shaking and was left visibly traumatized by what she did. She's not a monster, she's a 19 year old girl who lost everything, including herself.
Jesus It's 4AM and I just finished proof-reading everything, this post took me about 3 days to write and I really hope that someone reads at least half of it but I don't expect anyone to. Anyway.
Thank you for reading :)
TL;DR; Cried a lot, then cried some more.",0.6317179203033447
comments discussing characters of the game,"Another wonderful and thoughtful read from you, I’m so glad! I have to say at first that I too put the game away at some point, probably around the parts you did. It was crushingly dark and heavy, the mood was really getting to me. Now I’ve been replaying the game and am actually in the middle of another break. 😅 Gets to you, doesn’t it, these games we play?
Anyway! At the end of every play through I arrive at the same conclusion - that the story was worth the pain and darkness, I wouldn’t change a thing about it story-wise. And don’t get me wrong, I certainly hoped for something “better” for Ellie, the ending is devastating, but I also think the game earned the right to be that way. How do you feel having now finished the game? Again, thanks for this post, I’ll sure be coming back to it. 😊",0.6064957976341248
comments discussing characters of the game,"Thank you so much!
Yeah, it does get to you, but it's definitely worth it.
On the first chapter in the opening cinematic Joel sasy to Tommy ""You go halfway across the country with someone..."". The first day after finishing the game was weird, I've been playing as this character for the past month every single day, and now it's over.
Writing this post helped me reconnect with the game and reflect more intentionally on each character and their story, but it still doesn't feel like enough. Whether I replay it, watch gameplays, it all just feels like reliving a memory.
Joel is gone, and Ellie walked away. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I've played my fair share of story-driven games to know that most of them either provide closure or leave the ending open in a deliberate, satisfying way.
The ending of Part II felt more like a cliffhanger, leaning towards open-ended, perhaps to leave room in case a Part III never came. But honestly this game deserves a sequel, there's still so much to explore. Ellie was only just beginning her path toward healing. Her relationship with Dina, JJ, Tommy, and the community in Jackson all have more story to tell. The WLF is still active, the infected are everywhere, and the world remains brutal and broken. There are endless possibilities.
If a sequel ever happens, I trust the writers to deliver something meaningful again, something with closure hopefully, but without resorting to the predictable or cliché. In this case one that I could think of would be an ending where Ellie sacrifices herself for a cure. There's more to her story than that.",0.6284449696540833

comments discussing characters of the game,"Probably a hot take here, but... I don't really agree with the notion that a television show simply can't convey the story of Part II as well as the video game can. To be sure, to your point about how we're with the protagonist of a video game every second (which, worth noting, game writers largely ""show you"" a character's mental state through characters talking to themselves; that's largely how they do that in the medium. They're audio ""thought bubbles"" that, while sometimes used with success in television [see: Scrubs], is largely not something television audiences really enjoy). Or they pair up with a computer-controlled partner so that the protagonist can just keep talking and share those inside thoughts with (but is ultimately about communicating to the player).
In a show or movie, you have to show it through other means. This does usually include dialogue between characters too, to be sure, but also through other means. Like in the show, we could have a moment where Ellie goes ham on killing an infected and Dina needs to really yank her ""back to reality"" because she's lost control. We could have more moments that hint at friction between Dina and Ellie to show that while Ellie is able to take some pleasure right now in the good thing happening to her with this relationship, her descent is occurring and the seeds that strain could be planted. We could have had them find those Seraphite bodies, then find some WLF soldiers where Ellie winds up killing them in a way surprising even to herself because she was affected by the carnage she saw them bring and was subconsciously recalling the carnage on Joel. We could even just have a shot of Ellie writing a thought in her journal while Dina sleeps where we can see some text written to indicate she's getting darker.
We don't need to have Ellie ripping out throats from combat animations and increasingly disturbing comments in those moments. There's stuff the game does that is unique to games, but the core story here is not one that can only be conveyed through that medium. I think this show is fine. Not great. Not terrible. Great in some ways and making some changes I like (I like Ellie seeming younger, I feel like I always forget she's not 30 in these games, even if I wish they'd been working in the darkness more than they have, and I know I'm in the minority, but I so far love the changes they've made with Tommy). Mid-tier HBO show to me as a television fan. I think they're mostly doing ok getting the gist of things. But I don't think this is the best version of a television adaptation we could be getting. I'd honestly trade some of the production value of the sets and make-up (which are pretty incredible) for a more developed season.",0.6449727416038513
comments discussing characters of the game,"I do agree with most of these points, I failed to really mention in my post that I do think this could be a better adaptation when I was talking about how a 1:1 would not work. I also agree heavily with your thoughts about making Ellie seem younger which has always been an issue I've had with the game as well. I think Ellie looks way too old for 19 in the game when a major thematic aspect of it is how she is barely an adult, and is in a lot of ways still a child, doing the things she is doing in Part II.
I also think the changes they are making to Tommy are great and still keep him very in-line with his video game counterpart, I think a lot of fans really misinterpret game Tommy. Fundamentally, in my opinion, Tommy is the character that has changed the least in this adaptation and the changes made just reinforce what Neil and Halley were doing with him in Part II.",0.6277028918266296

comments discussing characters of the game,"The game story wouldn’t have worked in the show here because so much of what made that work is the medium of gameplay
Really the comedic undertone of Bill/Frank as portrayed in the game would have come off as really tone-deaf and out-of-place for a show like this, and for the fact that it's 2023 and most viewers are not impressed by ""we included a gay couple, there, are you satisfied?"" anymore and need more to make it more than a tired novelty but an actual story.
Honestly I wouldn't expect less of the creator of Chernobyl. If he adapted the game's storyline as direct as some of the other scenes that do work as-is, it wouldn't have felt right for the series. He's also sending a message that every part of this story is going to effect you, that this is a real world and nobody gets out being comedy relief or dismissible as just devices to drive the story somewhere.",0.6141823530197144
comments discussing characters of the game,"I dunno that Bill was depicted as comic relief? Dude seemed to be an angry, broken man who was doing his best to cling to what he had to the detriment of love or accommodations of the people he cared about.
The story with him was basically “if you aren’t willing to change for the people you love, then they can’t help but hate you,” and that was a reasonable thing to take away from it. After Bill and that brutal suicide note from Frank, Joel and Ellie are both a little more open to change. They weren’t quite ready to make the changes, and they both struggled a bit to make them properly, but they were trying.
I think that the show was more powerful and ultimately better, but I don’t think that the game fell short, and I don’t think Bill’s character aged poorly.",0.6060178875923157

comments discussing characters of the game,"GameBill represents the bitterness in rejecting the need for connection and focusing on survival at all costs.
ShowBill represents the joy that can come from being open and vulnerable, even in this shit world.
The game lets you infer it but the show explicitly points out he and joel play the same role, and I love that they flip GameBill from being a cautionary tale to ShowBill's aspirational tale, while keeping his fundamental character purpose, plot role and humour.
I also would have liked to see some Ellie/Bill interaction, and in the game for Ellie/Joel there's a bit of ""getta load of this guy"" bonding as well as them being in a bunch of danger and working together, but it was worth it for this story, and they can work in the deeper bonding later.",0.608862578868866

For me a good adaptation takes what exists in the original and expands it so it can bring more of the themes out. Also game and tv writing paces differently some plot or scenes will be different so it can work in a different medium. Bad adaptation can be trying too hard to be the same or changing too much of the core heart of the original characters or story. Like GoT I accepted fast travel for the sake of on screen pacing and aging actors. But it was annoying when characters like knight of flowers were written in ways that lost their core themes as characters.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I wonder if the writing went this route for a secondary reason as well. The writers had a difficult decision. I'm sure they started off with the concept of Bill from the game and I was really looking forward to this portrayal. The problem is the more back story you create, the more unlikeable ellie's relationship with Bill becomes. As the show runners want Joel to gradually like her and become her protector, they also want the viewers to do the same. It can be a struggle to get viewers to like precocious young girls. There was no need to make it harder.
If Bill is alive when Joel/ellie arrive, her comments to a grief stricken and broken man would take her character backwards. Stealing items from him and making fun of his gay porn might make viewers hate her. Bill allowing Frank to change the town’s vision was the only real change. The rest of the episode was the alternate universe result of that decision. In both the game and the TV show, Joel has a decision point as well. He can wallow in the past or move forward
Both universes exist and they are the ideal result in their individual worlds. I wonder if those who hate the episode are missing the point of both stories.",0.6246129274368286

Joel’s POV it was “oh, the dudes who I did business with are dead and we can take their shit now.” And Ellie’s is like “Oh, these dudes Joel mentioned right before coming here had a lot of shit that we can take.” Idk, great little love story but it just didnt fit snugly into the larger story in my opinion. Other gripes: we don’t get Bill and Ellie’s banter. Also it was fucking stupid that Ellie stole the gun. That’s just going to ruin the moment later when Joel begins to trust her enough to give her her own. Now she’ll save him with it, and it’ll just hurt his trust more.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Unfortunately, they did a poor job in the first game selling the idea that the Fireflies had the capability to create and distribute a vaccine, thus making it easier for people to step to one side of the moral conflict
The first game wasnt trying to sell you the idea that the cure was guaranteed. At best it was always a vague possibility with no clear cut outcome. I'm choosing to ignore Druckmann's personal statements on the cure being guaranteed because I don't think it matters and in some ways hurts the moral ambiguity of the choice.
The actual thing the first game was trying to sell you on, was Joel's arc. And it succeeded hundreds times over. Because I mean... just look at the discourse surrounding his character and choice.
At the end of the day. From a pragmatist perspective centred on the needs of humanity's survival. The price of one girl's life is a generously low cost to pay for the opportunity to find a path forward to saving mankind.
It doesn't matter what the outcome would be, even if it was a failed experiment. Because the only consequence is just one girl's life. Which is unfortunately outweighed by the needs of society, no matter how you rationalise it.
However from Joel perspective. That one girl's life means basically everything to him. It isn't her immunity or existence as a potential cure. Its their surrogate relationship that has brought meaning back into his life
Ellie's death, essentially equates to his own, as his life would be functionally meaningless if she were gone. I'm one of those people who sincerely believes that if Ellie had been operated on and died. Joel would have ended his own life as he would have had nothing left.
We as the audience have 100% been sold into Joel's arc. The game uses every cliche, trope and shorthand trick to get the audience to side with and justify Joel. People will bend over backwards and commit extraordinary mental gymnastics to defend his choice. And the debates surrounding the cures feasibility is just an extension of that.
And thats not necessarily a bad thing. Thats the whole point of the game. To blur the lines of morality and the value of human life. And to show the underlying selfishness that exists at the core of parental love.",0.6006545424461365
comments discussing characters of the game,"Long comment and late reply, but the idea I was trying to get across is that Joel was acting from understandable human instinct. The fireflies ARE acting like tuskegee experimenters and other medical research atrocities — the doctors were acting from desperation to prevent horrific disease.  
It is the writers creating these moral questions, Joel is only a character. The writers chastised his choice publicly using the torture / bomb logic. They create a sort of facsimile of moral ambiguity; they treat Joel as in the wrong and an instigator of blood feud. They equalize the fireflies. It doesn’t matter that Ellie semi consented — women today have a baby in the hospital and consent to that treatment then get surprise gyno exams while knocked out. Consent is either informed or not actually consent at all. Ellie kills hundreds, gets to Abby, stops. Another boring gaming trope.
I just find the writing frustrating. The characters are charismatic, but the central thesis of the plot fails. I think it could be improved substantially if the writers were willing to engage with historical context & philosophy in a more deep way than scanning wikipedia and reading reddit threads.

Regarding having it both ways with the point about revenge; I’m not sure that these are incompatible points it’s trying to make.

Unilateral kindness isn’t enough, it requires both parties to step back from the cycle of violence. Abby has already learned that by the time she leaves Ellie to run off to California with Lev and Ellie realises it when she’s trying to drown an emaciated, half-dead Abby to death.

comments discussing characters of the game,"What's limited about it. I think its a little disingenuous to say that the game doesn't give you multiple ways of going about any given combat situation.

Even a simple brick or bottle can get you out of a situation in multiple ways. The maps tend to have a lot of different avenues of approach and there's a nice amount of variety between human encounters and infected.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I agree with some of your points, though not all. Especially the gameplay is very enjoyable to me (even though I don’t like horror). But I still believe that the story would work way better if the game were structured differently or simply a movie. And that’s mostly due to the fact that most players will take some breaks, maybe play something else for a few days, etc. and simply in general not finish the game in 1-2 weeks. And IMO in that case many of the nuisances and story details get easily lost. Many players won’t remember most of Ellie’s motivation during day 1, when playing Abbie’s Day 1 or 2.
Also, I have issues with the differences and gaps between gameplay and the rest of the story. Both Abby and Ellie kill hundreds, it’s not easy to stay sympathetic to their motivations. At times it feels like to me Neil/ND didn’t want to do a videogame and are mostly interested in story-telling.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Story-wise, I agree with quite a lot of your criticism, and you did a good job of explaining why you didn't like certain things. I still liked it overall, more or less, but I do think some of the points you make are very true, particularly when it comes to some missed opportunities for discussion and self-reflection on the part of the characters, and never having Ellie or Abby really contend with exactly who the other person was.
I totally agree that the game tries to have it both ways with Abby, and her behavior at the start of the game never quite gelled with the person we come to know later on when we play as her. I think some tweaks to the scene with Joel at the beginning could have solved this, but they leaned a little to hard into the brutality to make it more shocking.
I was also very frustrated with Ellie's flip-flopping on Abby, and her insistence on continuing her quest for revenge even after Abby spared her own life twice. I understand that you're meant to be frustrated with Ellie to some extent, but my issue was that I didn't think the game did enough to make me believe that Ellie would actually make the decision to go back after Abby towards the end of the game. The PTSD and Tommy guilt-tripping her wouldn't have been enough to rekindle her bloodlust in my opinion, especially given that at that point she's been spared twice by Abby, knows her motive, and on some level has still never been able to completely forgive Joel for what he did at the end of the first game. I wish we got to hear her dealing with that aspect of things a little more explicitly.
Gameplay-wise though... I have to say that I pretty much completely disagree. In fact probably the main reason why I still thought the game was pretty great overall despite some significant reservations with the narrative was that I found the combat to be incredible. On a moment to moment level, I was almost always engaged, and found the combat encounters tense and exciting nearly the entire time. The balance between naturalistic character animation and well-executed enemy behavior and AI made it one of the most satisfying third-person stealth/action games I've ever played.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Well said, you've clearly illustrated my main issue with the game as a whole. Whatever message they were going for about the destructive nature of revenge or the double-edged blade of love is diminished by the fact that at pivotal moments in the story, the actions of the main characters often feel like they're being dictated by the writers rather than being natural extensions of the characters' histories, personalities and motivations. Not that they come completely out of left field or anything, but it just wasn't enough for me to fully buy in to their decisions at times.
What saved the game for me was the gameplay, the nearly-unmatched production values, and the fact that within the individual scenes, the writing and performances are so good that it was often easy (for me, at least) to ignore the overarching narrative issues when I was in the moment.",0.6078475117683411
comments discussing characters of the game,"particularly when it comes to some missed opportunities for discussion and self-reflection on the part of the characters, and never having Ellie or Abby really contend with exactly who the other person was.
The more I think about it, the more I feel this is one of the big problems of the game. It's a game that asks you, the player to consider that there are two sides to every story and that perspective matters...and yet it denies the chance for the characters to learn that same lesson. Because Ellie doesn't learn anything about Abby other than the fact that she's the daughter of the surgeon who was going to cut her brain open and she has a transgender kid companion for some reason.
For a game that's also meant to be about understanding and empathy, the characters don't seem to do much of it at all. Even Ellie sparing Abby at the end feels less like ""I understand how that Abby is a complex person with complex motives and she had her reasons for killing Joel"" and more like she's just tired and exhausted from all this. It's not a bad reason to want to stop, but the game doesn't earn it in my opinion. Probably because Ellie was supposed to kill Abby originally",0.6060037612915039

comments discussing characters of the game,"The game is not trying to say “revenge bad”. People have this weird thing where art has a defined correct message. The writers didn’t sit there and go “hmm today we are going to write a story and the theme is revenge bad”. Now they may be saying “we want to write a story that examines the cycle of revenge, human kindness, etc, but they aren’t writing a game with the intention of having a theme. There isn’t a right or wrong answer to “what’s the theme of the game”. You as the person interacting with the art draw your own conclusions. So it’s not inherently bad writing for the game to have moments that contradict your interpretation of the game. I don’t think they really intended anyone to take away “Revenge bad”. In my opinion, the more interesting way to view the game is from this perspective. You start the game watching this terrible person murder your favorite character. You watch the grief consume Ellie as she loses more and more of her humanity in this hunt for Abby. Then you eventually swap to Abby, you slowly start rooting for her (and yourself) as she goes through the story. You realize she’s not just some evil person, she like Ellie is capable of empathy and courage but her grief over her fathers death drove her to lose her humanity as well. Neither of them is really a “villain”. They both just seek to avenge those they cared about. Its a story about bonds and grief and how violence and hatred can cause us to lose ourselves and our humanity.",0.6073447465896606

comments discussing characters of the game,"I mean your point is the same as saying “Lord of the Rings story is good guys better than evil guys!”. Or saying Lord of the Files theme is “humans are evil”. What you said is you didn’t like how mercy and kindness are shown to be weaknesses while the game is saying “revenge bad being nice good!”. My point is that’s a very simplistic way of looking at the story. The story doesn’t have some point. It’s not trying to teach you some message. It wants to tell an interesting story between two characters consumed by vengeance. It draws parallels between them and wants you to think about how you view both. What you want to take away from the game is up you. But it’s not bad writing that the game isn’t a string of events that all point to one simple message. Sometimes revenge works out sometimes kindness works out and sometimes they result in terrible situations but ultimately it’s the violence and the grief and the trauma that drive the characters. Do you get what I’m saying. It’s not that “revenge is bad and not worth it”. It’s “Ellie's and Abby's quests for vengeance against each other ultimately demonstrate that while the instinct for violence can be all consuming, the path to a meaningful future lies in finding forgiveness and letting go of hatred”. It’s the same as LoTR isn’t “being good always wins!” Its “ordinary people are capable of great courage and heroism, and that the true way to defeat the inherit evil of humanity is through kindness and sacrifice not domination”. Sure you can summarize the second thesis into the first but it doesn’t mean they’re the same. Why is revenge bad? Why do good guys always win? That’s what these stories are about",0.6186978816986084

So I had a very unbiased look going into it. I was absolutely devastated over what happened to Joel. Like stopped the game and cried for two hours devastated, I cried harder than I did when my grandma died.
I didn’t have Joel on this pedestal that a good chunk of the fans did and still do, we know he’s done some awful things, the “I’ve been on both sides” line after the ambush by the faction in Pittsburgh, and Tommy saying “I have nothing but nightmares from those years”
And you know what’s hilarious? Abby has the same story that Joel had. Jaded by a great loss of a family member driven to do some horrible shit where they eventually meet a kid that changes their view about things, going on to be a better person.
I understand disliking Abby as a character, but her story is the same as Joel’s, so I’m kinda of the opinion that you can’t dislike Abby’s story while praising Joel’s, in fact I would go as far to say a lot of the hate towards her is rooted in misogyny.",0.6223341822624207

comments discussing characters of the game,"Did Abby get buff to seek revenge? Yes, on Joel. She said this during one of the cut scenes. Does her buffness serve her dedication to WLF, etc.? Absolutely.
I also want to stress that, while I agree with you (to an extent), I never said that Abby's overall ""hatred"" didn't also come from other experiences too. Okay? I was talking SPECIFICALLY about the Abby-Ellie relationship, and THAT hatred. You're adding more to this conversation than I was even talking about. Furthermore, these characters were written and designed to be extremely complex. It would be a discredit to the forethought of the designers and writers to disregard the fact that the game has a lot of symbolism throughout, and appearances, to an extent, have been part of that. It's undeniable. Experiences physically change us, and I love that they decided to showcase these experiences. If you don't, that's totally fine. Everybody has experienced this game very differently, which is a feat that should be celebrated, not argued.

Show Ellie is still acting like a child, not someone who is jaded by the fact that they’re racked with survivors guilt.
Day 1 romance scene in this show is so fucking undeserved, and stupidly rushed. Not to mention Ellie being super chill about her pregnancy when in this situation she would be freaking the fuck out being this far behind enemy lines, and on her mission.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I think your criticisms are valid, and fair.
I personally disagree with a lot of it, but hey, art is subjective. My biggest gripe with Ellie is not in Bella’s performance, but how it’s being written.
I can’t say that Bella isn’t doing a great job of conveying Ellie’s grief, rage and her relentless violent tunnel-vision. Rather, the writing doesn’t appear to be giving Bella a chance to express this. They’re so focused on the vulnerability of the character, and far less about the many conflicting emotions she feels about the task at hand and Joel’s death.
They haven’t lost me yet; I’m still engaged. That said- Day 2 is HUGE in the expression of Ellie’s relentless rage and lust for revenge at all costs… I need this next episode to do a lot in terms of that rage and that absence of humanity. I know it isn’t realistic in the confines of the show for Ellie to be murdering WLF and Seraphites in droves, but I need to see the pure lack of regard for human life she carries in the game.
If they fail to do this, her later encounter with Mel and Owen will fall extremely flat (if they don’t opt to change how that plays out, too).",0.619473934173584

comments discussing characters of the game,"You gotta divorce yourself from your favorite quotes & how it was acted in the game.
Bella is acting the shit out of the lines she’s been given. The scene with her crying by Joel’s clothes in his closet was top tier acting. I’m really at a loss for ppl not connecting to the moments we are getting instead of just keeping a running catalog of “it was different in the game.”
We’ll get the actual porch scene next season I reckon. Showing Joel on the porch doesn’t take away that moment.
Spelling out Abby’s motivations is the TV producers protecting Kaitlyn & I’m all for it. Some of you all have forgotten how ugly it got for Laura Bailey.
Episode 4 had so many moments directly from the game.
Episode 3 wasn’t a filler episode & too many of you all do t understand what a filler episode actually is.
A lot of ppl in this thread are downvoting ppl liking thr tv show & upvoting ppl hating on the tv show. But then also commenting that ppl can’t handle discussions. If that were the case, every comment in this thread would be on the positive number side as every comment, for or against, are contributing to the discussion.
The TV show is an adaptation & so things will be changed. Some things work in a video game that don’t work on TV. Being at peace with that will help you deal with change.
Also, I highly recommend listening to the official podcast of the tv show with Craig, Neil, & Troy. It’ll help you understand the creative choices they make and WHY they made them.",0.6398995518684387

You've literally said every single thing I've been thinking about the show so far. The writing isn't there and some of the casting is off. They keep changing and watering down incredibly important lines that tell you so much about the characters state of mind and who they are. Take your Josh Peck and go home please. He doesn't fit, like when Ed Sheeran was in Game of Thrones for no reason. All of the random ""fuck"" in everyones sentences aren't cool, they don't add anything, write something actual dialogue.
Seems like they're just changing stuff because they want to and writing themselves to an early grave. 7 episodes isn't nearly enough. What's season 3 going to be 5 episodes?

I feel the same way as the time spent with the Scars and WLF. That entire war/conflict was background noise in the game, especially Ellie’s 3 days, but even Abby separated herself from WLF before Day 1 ended.

What isn't allowed are nasty remarks or personal attacks. If someone is making such comments, please do not engage them yourself as they are most likely just looking for validation and attention. Just report such comments and we will get around to them eventually.",0.6519345641136169
comments discussing characters of the game,"I think the thing that’s interesting to me in a lot of the discussion about TLOU2 is how it revealed to me how differently a lot of people reacted to 1.
To me the end of the first game is deeply uncomfortable, because you can simultaneously empathise with Joel, while also recognising that what he did can easily be considered terrible.
But in a lot of the commentary about 2, many people talk about how they felt that the end of 1 feels like you ‘win’, a feeling that’s missing from the ending of 2. To me, the end of 1 didn’t feel like I ‘won’ at all. Joel hasn’t just condemned humanity to a bleak future, he’s also arguably sowed the seeds of the end of his relationship with Ellie.",0.6037862300872803
comments discussing characters of the game,"You’re missing the point. Some people are not going to just believe in a bunch of hypothetical situations that the game makes no comment on. The fact is the game does not explicitly show us that the fireflies can make the cure. What the game does explicitly show us is that the fireflies are desperate, incompetent, morally corrupt, untrustworthy, and on their last legs. They are introduced by bombing a qz zone. Have lore about how they could not hold grounds they took over. Have lore about failed experiments. Have lore about terrorist actions. Tommy left them before the game even started. They can’t even transport their most important asset. Why would the devs write them like this? Are we supposed to believe in them? Why should we believe that they can do something that’s never been done before in a situation like this? Just because they said so?
The game also shows us a bunch of situations where a cure wouldn’t solve the problem. There is still human conflict. Still a lack of food. Still power and infrastructure issues. Sure you can make a place like Jackson, but obviously you don’t need a cure for that.
If you want to believe that everything would work out perfectly and all would be well if the fireflies killed Ellie, go for it. Not everyone is convinced of that, and that is solely based on the writing of the game. If the game wanted me to believe the fireflies could make the cure, it would not have given me a bunch reasons not to believe they could. If the game wanted me to believe the cure would save the world, it would not show me a bunch of situations where a cure wouldn’t help.",0.6022348403930664
comments discussing characters of the game,"About your first spoiler tag, I was arguing with people on the TLOU2 subreddit after the game first came out and I quickly realized that many people didn't pay attention to the first story. They went through the game killing everything in sight and then were confused as to what happened in TLOU2 and influenced by the comments calling it nonsensical.",0.6301679015159607
comments discussing characters of the game,"Now about Abby .... at first, i couldn’t connect with her at all. Honestly, i didn’t really like her or care much for her group. But everything changed once she met Lev. That relationship opened up a whole new side of Abby that i hadn’t seen. I started to understand. And by the end of the game, i didn’t agree with the haters, i actually liked Abby. It really felt like i had played two different characters across the game’s dual narrative, and both stories mattered.
Something I rarely see discussed is that by the end of the game, Abby became the thing she hated most: She became Joel.
It's not a perfect 1:1 comparison. But consider: Both suffered a terrible loss. Both turned to a life of violence. Both were miserable. Both of them (somewhat reluctantly) had to care for a younger person. But that relationship developed and blossomed and they started feeling whole again. They stop surviving, and start living.
I also really like what they did with her dream sequences. She gets her revenge by killing Joel, but she's still haunted by the dreams of her dead father. It's only after she chooses to go back and help Lev that she has a dream where she encounters her father alive and happy.
The depths of her character are there, if you want to look.",0.6155921220779419
comments discussing characters of the game,"I played the game, even after the leaks. Played it again recently and the story is still dogshit and rushed.",0.626716136932373
comments discussing characters of the game,I was fine with the game until Tommy came to the farm and started insisting that Ellie should finish the job and called her coward. That was really out of the place and did not justify the further story in my opinion.,0.6077187061309814
comments discussing characters of the game,"Yea, I agree, and a big reason to why I somewhat shake my head regarding statements such as that. Games confronting uncomfortable or ambiguous stuff is really nothing new but people can be really sensitive when that stuff feels like it is lacking depth and is only done for shock value. Basically, they can tell apart games where the suffering is making a point vs those where suffering is the point.
Unfortunately for me, Part 2 falls into the later camp. You can just really see the strings where the game just constantly pulls and directs the story towards misery rather than it being a natural tragedy. Just feels really artificial as a result.",0.60528165102005
comments discussing characters of the game,"The game has got serious issues with pacing, believability, conflicting themes, unlikable characters, and an overwhelming and almost comical amount of misery. It’s an exhausting experience for a lot of people and not in a self reflective way. I think a lot of the vitriol was because of that.",0.6459354758262634

comments discussing characters of the game,"2 is such a beautiful mess to me. So many good things, right along some truly terrible decisions. To me at least, the core idea of making you play as the character you hate did work, as by the end I was rooting for them both to just walk away.
And it definitely sticks with you, and I can see why people give it a 8,9 or 10 (if a 10 to you can include flaws if the rest of the game makes up for it enough), but I can also fully understand why people would say it’s a 3 or 4. The only people I truly don’t get is anyone who claims the game is just complete trash 1/10 and I assume they haven’t played it, and just want to push their BS agenda crap. Or pretty much the opposite with people who plug their ears and refuse to listen to any criticism of anything related to the game.",0.6452566981315613

comments discussing characters of the game,I think the games are one of the best written narratives in gaming. I find it comical people love Joel but hate Abby so much when Abby is 100% Joel. Joel wasn't a good guy. Anyone who actually payed attention would know as much. He was a bitter person after his daughter's death and he got up to some terriblet things. It wasn't until he met Ellie that his redemption truly began. Abby goes through a very similar arc.,0.6354405283927917
comments discussing characters of the game,"It's my favorite example of art not giving you what you want, but what you deserve. This was a singular gaming experience because it took me on the full range of emotions:
Excitement to see Ellie and Joel together. Disappointment and concern. Heartbreak. Rage
My god, the first time you get to Seattle and start killing WLFs felt satisfying. I remember standing UP from the couch when Ellie finally got Nora in her sights. Genuinely electric.
Then the basement. And the theater. And the POV change.
My god. The absolute balls to do that. Then the slow climb up thru there. Seeing the effects of Ellie stalking thru Seattle second hand. Lev and Yara.
And then the theater. Again.
I genuinely thought the farm was the end (at first). Tommy came and my heart dropped. I knew what was coming but I couldn't believe it when they started walking to the boats together. Had to put the controller down when Ellie threatened Lev. Truly her darkest moment....
And then the porch. Fucking in-cred-i-ble move, recontextualizing the entire game. Ellie's rage isn't just for Abby, she's externalized her own self-loathing. The game ""promises"" a revenge quest, but it gives you so much more.
tl;dr No other game made me feel with the characters so well, only to make me feel for them as I watch them make decisions that I know are bad for them. You could not do this story with fresh characters. Only killing someone people have loved (and in some cases had a parasocial relationship with) for years would trigger the same emotional reaction.",0.6172167658805847
comments discussing characters of the game,"It's almost ""un-reviewable"".
Every ""game"" aspect of it is executed well, but some people just couldn't connect with it because of what Naughty Dog chose to do with the story.

They filmed that scene with her eyes crossed, and they just left it in
Someone most likely wrote” I’m going to be a dad” comment.
The fact that most of the actors were told not to play the game, which means they have no idea truly of the source material, and they are bringing to life a beloved game to the Silver screen.
I 100%. Don’t hate Bella, but I do hate everybody who’s working on this movie behind the scenes. Especially Neil. I think a lot of this can be contributed to Neil. I think he almost wanted to remastered his old work.
All I can hold for is that they’re actually going to redo the entire series, and a couple of years. And just call it. The last of us remastered. Fingers crossed.",0.6059992909431458

I've never played the game, and frankly I don't care what Ellie is ""supposed to be like"".

I scroll reddit all the time and have never been bothered to make a throwaway account to post something until this point.
I truly think that anyone who is hating on this show, or her in particular, is either uncomfortable with the fact that she isn't a heterosexual conventionally attractive woman, or are too attached to the game that they can't allow for any deviation from what they think it should be like. 
And for the a lot of the ones in the second half of that last sentence, I think that's just an excuse and they really fall under category A(misogyny).

comments discussing characters of the game,"Very well said- I completely agree with you. I only played the game once a few years ago so I don’t remember all these details but I recall thinking and feeling the same thing about the Fireflies. In fact, I specifically remember seeing people buy merchandise with the Firefly logo on it and thinking, “why the hell would anyone want to associate themselves with the Fireflies?!!!”
The thing is, I don’t know if this is what was intended by the creators. The whole game is built around Joel’s decision to save his newly adopted daughter rather than the rest of humanity. If the Fireflies really aren’t able to deliver the cure, then that seriously undercuts the ending. For that reason, I think if you were to ask them, the creators would say that the Fireflies could definitely have made a cure. Personally I didn’t trust them AT ALL. I remember feeling conflicted about it because I couldn’t be sure, but Joel’s actions didn’t exactly shock me.",0.6006646156311035

comments discussing characters of the game,"Thanks for that, I haven’t played since i finished it when it released so seeing you comment was nice to open the convo back up hah. I appreciate it cuz honestly this brought some nice clarity to ideas I have always struggled with.
I never thought about it but I agree choosing marlene over the surgeon to derive the character of Abby’s background would’ve at least made me relate more as well. But again, your point about Joel ascending back to humanity just makes anyone who wanted to side with the surgeon less relatable. And Especially their random daughter. Like the whole point of the final decision in the first one was so incredible, it doesn’t make sense to punish him, (and destroy all that character development) as the basis for the next plot.
I wish they didn’t go for the mustache twirling villainous plot line. They could’ve just road horses, and talked about giraffes for 20 hours of gameplay as long as it was Elly and Joel growing with the same great commentary. Lol.
In a sea of pretty meh zombie storylines, you get TLOU and see the potential of amazing storytelling, only to be let a bit down with the sequel. It is the best still.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Yeah I completely agree and personally the people waving off bad reviews because Ellie is gay and Abby is well, Abby, are so annoying.
I loved Ellie in the first one, she was a great character, I literally could not care less if she's gay or straight, it doesn't change the story for me.
I kinda get what they were trying to do with the story but holy shit it did not work out. I mean there was literally nothing positive about it and I'm sorry but you need positivity unless you're intentionally making something to just be depressing
I get it, it's the end of the world with zombies etc but dear God the story wasn't just depressing it was so poorly written. It was an absolute slog to get through and it's not like the game's known for its riveting gameplay.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I definitely agree. The Fireflies made me skeptical since the start of the game, when they blew up the QZ. It gave me some red flags, considering that they were bombing a supply truck with innocent bystanders nearby. Meeting Marlene made me even more suspicious, especially in her statement that you listed above. However, as Joel seemed to have history with her and trusted her enough to do the 'supply run' with Ellie, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she'd had a reason for destroying the truck? And besides, I have no idea what kind of facilities they have, maybe they have good scientists who could make a vaccine work. Y'know, the whole ""for the good of the human race"" thing. But with each passing chapter of the game, it grew on me that the Fireflies had no idea what they were doing. And by the time we'd got to the ending and Joel had made it to the hospital, I knew this vaccine wasn't getting made. I knew that Ellie was gonna die if they attempted to get a cure, and that Joel wouldn't stand for it, not after everything they'd gone through together.",0.6137692332267761
comments discussing characters of the game,"Sure, I agree that the main point of the game is “the Lie” . But I have no problem thinking that they possibly could have potentially done something.

""Druckmann: Tess was the antagonist chasing Joel, and she ends up torturing him at the end of the game to find out where Ellie went, and Ellie shows up and shoots and kills Tess. And that was going to be the first person Ellie killed. But we could never make that work, so…
Straley: Yeah, it was really hard to keep somebody motivated just by anger. What is the motivation to track, on a vengeance tour across an apocalyptic United States, to get, what is it, revenge? You just don’t buy into it, when the stakes are so high, where every single day we’re having the player play through experiences where they’re feeling like it’s tense and difficult just to survive.

comments discussing characters of the game,"This is a great read. I dont want to sound like im opposing but I wanted to hear your points to some ive read regarding the development since im less informed.
1) ive read that TLoU was in a sense Drucjmann’s baby in that he originally submitted a similar idea during his college days in 2004. We dont get the details of the actual project but you could argue it is the basis for TLoU.
2) i do wonder how much the influence of “feminist” writers had on TLoU2. Druckmann seems to be kind of “sensitive” to such criticisms, given that one of the original ideas was to have only women be infected by the parasite but this was rejected for being too demeaning to women which honestly sounds stupid to me (Is Children of Men “sexist” because the mystery virus makes women infertile in the movie?). Druckmann seems to be someone that could be swayed to make more radical changes to not appear anti-feminist.
3) given how much influence the actors themselves also had on the game, I wonder if they expressed their objection during certain scenes like Joel getting his face smashed in by Abby. Mark Hamil seemed to express to RJ multiple times that he needed to think of the fans when making TLJ even though they fell on deaf ears and Joel’s voice actor is one of the biggest voice actors in the industry.",0.6176741123199463

Whether the actors like the path the characters go down - I don't care. Why should that matter? The woman that played Ellie gave an absolutely astonishing performance. Pretty sure she won awards, right? Does it matter if she doesn't like what they do with the character of she can give such an impactful performance anyway? More to the point, why should her view of Ellie and what Ellie would do be more important than a writer, game designer or, for that matter, the player at the end of the experience?

In this particular case, OP made a post reviewing a game and was very conscientious about not spoiling anything in the post body, just as any professional game review outlet would do.

They redacted the trailer of Joel—of what ended up being Jesse—in a heartfelt scene saying, ""You think I'd let you do this on your own?"" Instead, they ripped the rug from underneath us, give the lines to a new character, and kill him off an hour/two hours into the game. I don't even care about the gnarly way he's taken out. It's an apocalyptic world where survival is an issue at every turn, and a gruesome death may be an instant away.
I don't hate the game at all, it usurped the original in gameplay in almost everyway, and in many areas, has vastly more evocative level design. But, the ham-fisted flashbacks and attempt to force virtue signaling onto Abby was not enjoyable aspects of the game.

Mechanically, I think it’s one of the best feeling games that NaughtyDog has put out in terms of mechanics. The gunplay felt well connected and the combat had such a smooth flow to it… being able to choose between a stealthy approach or to go in guns blazing really left an open-ended feeling to what was a very-linear game. They did a superb job( imo ) of storytelling both sides of the story and although I wasn’t super happy about the ending… I got it. By the end, it felt like I had been on one hell of a journey with Ellie/Abby.

Reading these really enthusiastic previews while most of them are mentioning the extreme brutality of the game I kinda wonder whether there'll ever be a level of brutality in video games where it leads to critics point it out as a negative thing, as something too much for the medium.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Yeah, many of these comments aren't attacking the game for being violent - if this were a normal year I'm sure there'd be no problem. It's just so depressing to many for being weathered over with so many things happening at once, such as this quarantine, being stuck at home, still having to balance work and making ends meet, and to top it off some more violence going on in parts of the US. There's so much to take in, so people (like my older brother) prefer playing Animal Crossing, Apex Legends, or other games with friends. Having a narrative that makes you invested in characters and possibly depressed or crying by the end of it may not help as much with mental fortitude. It's best to try and take it easy and maybe play some more mindless games that're either innocent or don't run the risk of you having too much shock factor for violence.",0.6699310541152954

comments discussing characters of the game,"A lot of the backlash I saw was honestly low-effort anti-gay and anti-trans stuff. It's really pathetic. I doubt most of the people saying Neil Cuckmann, or calling people SJWs actually played or even enjoyed the first game. It's a really sad existence to spend your time being hateful I'd say.
This kind of labeling is played out. Star Wars tried that approach too: ""everyone who doesn't like it is just a bigot"". Choose some new copya pasta arguments. Regarding The Last of Us 2 people had a problem with the story undercutting the characters they felt they had grown to know and love from the first game and some of the plot threads they thought would be satisfying resolved in a sequel.
And having new characters come out of nowhere who are major who, we'll say break the mold of expectations, and hijack that story are going to get alot of flak. Just Like Rose Tico in Star Wars. It wasn't her character or the actress, it was the bad writing and the derailing of the story and her not adding much to it that made people dislike her inclusion.
  Maybe the game will be great and play those elements well in actual gameplay. If it is it'll shut those people up. But you don't know anymore than they do right now and trying to paint them all with a broad brush is just as bad as them trying to paint the game with a broad brush before it's released.

Its impact was lessoned to due overuse in the original and it sounds like this one is continuing the pattern with how much the emotional aspect is being touted. I was hoping I could have just considered the 1st as a prequel story that set up the drama between two characters while this fully explored post apocalyptic life.
On the plus side, I'm glad the gameplay is being talked about as well. It was by far my favorite part of of the 1st and kept me going with how well designed the levels and mechanics were. The tension they are talking about is what might make me pick this up eventually.",0.6042551398277283

JRPGs are not always happy go lucky affairs; though often the gruesome or brutal events that motivate characters happened ten years in the past, to characters you never met, or behind closed doors. They describe them, but don’t show them.
Then, the stories in those games are about overcoming that desire to let the world fall into despair as a result of those hardships.
That kinda fits to me - reality for all of us is harsh and full of lots of things we don’t want to deal with - and then a video game acknowledges (not depicts) these hardships and does something different to address them.

I have little to nothing to add here, since I agreed with everything you pointed out. I just never paid the prologue this much attention, but you were spot on.
I remember going into the game and feeling I did not know where I was. All of these characters I spent so many ours with, getting used to their voices and the way they think...none of that was there. Oddly enough, only Maria felt like herself. At the time, I could not put my finger on it, but I surely could tell I did not feel good. Going back in the way Part II did felt unpleasant, like changing cities and then coming back to see that all my friends changed their personalities and made new friends. I don't know. It did not feel welcoming as it should.
The only section of this game that is worth playing is the museum, and it is not a coincidence: it is the only section of the game that is somewhat faithful to the spirit of the original game.",0.6275376677513123
comments discussing characters of the game,"what an in depth analysis!
Thank you! There's a lot more I wanted to add tbh, but Reddit's character limit got in the way ...
I remember going into the game and feeling I did not know where I was.
That's exactly the effect of those retcons, they negatively impact our immersion right from the start, even if only subconsciously. We do not believe what we see, it feels wrong. I don't think that I've ever experienced such an absurd amount of retcons in such a short amount of time tbh, it's effectively a complete rewrite. Take the operating room for example. It's not just a matter of a few redesigned assets here or there, that room is a completely different place in Part II, unrecognizable!
But what annoys me most about those retcons is how underhanded and manipulative they are. Take a look at this shot Ellie for example --> timestamped link and imgur link to a screenshot. Lying on a clean operating table, right next to a tray full of surgical instruments, while Joel himself narrates: ""And because of her ... They were actually going to make a cure"". Everything is in order, and Ellie looks completely calm and serene. At peace. The impression one gets: this is what was supposed to happen, the vaccine was within reach ... until Joel comes along and wreaks havoc ... Compare that shot of Ellie with how TLoU depicted that ""operating room"" and it feels like Part II is set in some weird alternate universe.
Part II just feels wrong right from the start. These are the opening sentences of the game:
I don't know what happened. I was supposed to deliver her to the Fireflies and walk away.
What? Joel doesn't know what happened? The Joel of TLoU knew exactly what was happening, and what he had to do to prevent it, he was resolved and determined. The wording in the prologue however portrays Joel as unsure of himself, somehow conflicted and doubtful, while he recounts what happened with a shaky voice, thereby signaling to new players how they are supposed to feel about the character and his actions (""Idk, this feels wrong, he was supposed to deliver Ellie to the Fireflies and walk away, instead he murdered all of them?"").
Since the prologue never establishes that the Fireflies actually forcefully took Ellie (while she was unconscious the entire time) it really comes across now as if Joel was some kind of kidnapper ... I mean, it only makes sense when you don't know the original game, when THIS is all the information you get.
Another thing: Joel says ""I told her ... her immunity meant nothin'"" to Tommy. The wording here comes across as hurtful and inconsiderate imo, as if Joel either didn't understand or didn't care for Ellie's feelings, ""your immunity doesn't mean anything, move on"", which is NOT how the original game portrayed it of course.
Just like in the rest of the game Joel chooses the most bare bones answer here and presents himself in the worst manner possible, while omitting anything that might portray him in a more favourable light. And his answer to Tommy's question if Ellie believed him? ""Didn't say otherwise."" No. That's not Joel.
Joel's ""her immunity meant nothin'"" is part of this general retcon of Ellie's motivation, that she now ""wanted her immunity to mean something"", which completely breaks her character imo, as I already pointed out in the actual post. It's one of the biggest issues of Part II. The sequel was supposed to be Ellie's game, but she not only gets destroyed and effectively discarded, Druckmann also fundamentally botched her entire characterisation right from the start. Baffling.",0.6017104983329773

You could keep that backbone and build a narrative that would genuinely be interesting, thought provoking and one that would satisfy almost every fan of the first game. Doing that would've been totally possible but that would've required good intentions, subtle but 'deep' storytelling in the small moments ( kinda like the broken watch of Joel's in the first game) and above all else, nuance that would leave room for differing but understandable perspectives both by the characters and by the audience alike.",0.6246021389961243

Why make this character white/r all of a sudden? Just ... why? Why not let him stay a black man? And make Abby a black woman as well? Why not? But Druckmann tried to pull off every trick in the book to make ""Jerry"" and Abby more palatable to the players, so he just had to make him the most lily white, nicey-nice vanilla guy ever.

comments discussing characters of the game,"In the words of a certain ""video game donkey"" ""The relationship between Joel and Ellie is what defined the first game.. just as its absence defines the second""
just because you didn't like how the certain character developments played out doesn't make it a bad game. Or Dr.uckmann a bad writer.
Take how YOU feel about the happenings of the game out of the equation. And you have an incredibly tightly knit story. Written, acted, animated, and directed (gameplay and cinematics wise) To near perfection..
(That whole thing with Mel taking her nearly born baby into active combat and the insertion of politics with the ""why would it be owens choice"" kinda tilted me. I'd say that's the one contrivance that kind of pulled me out.) But even at that you can kinda just be like. ""Okay so she's just an a-hole"" and leave it at that

comments discussing characters of the game,"Spot on! Having recently replayed the game and watched the show, I felt too that the second game is trying to sell a narrative that it didn’t bother to set in the first game.
My argument against Jerry is that he did not answer till the very end to Marlene that if he would have so easily sacrificed the girl if it was his daughter. The way Joel was frantic about Ellie, Marlene could tell that they have a bond, she still does not give him a choice and rather gave him an indirect death sentence.
Every story has a “trigger” which sets off the narrative, climbs the arc, and ends in climax. If Joel’s brutal death was the trigger, then it should have ended with a climax in the trajectory leading to a confrontation between the protagonist and the antagonist. Instead, the pace drops right off, you are now to follow a different character, new weapons, new characters, new game tbh. Then the scars v wolf story trigger kicks off, and properly ends with the village fight. Only for the story curve to drop to a perpendicular and put you back with Ellie hunting down Abby? This is against basic storytelling.
Without getting into finale and the horrible ending, this game fails to tell the story with proper focus on structure.
If you throw this criticism around, there is a huge faction of woke people calling gamers “dudebros” and “neckbeard incels” claiming that the critics are bigots, anti-feminists, transphobic, and anti-semite. What has criticism of the game story structure got to with the director’s religion? What has it got to do with what is the skin color of Joel? Or if Ellie is a Lesbian or not? I LOVED playing as Ellie, and while I hated Abby’s story structure and unsolicited call for sympathy, I gave zero shits about her biceps.
I eventually folded and kept the criticism to myself, accepting that these people are simply not loyal to the franchise and most probably haven’t played the first or the second game.",0.6334825754165649
comments discussing characters of the game,"To be clear the OP was not talking about graphics, he was talking about the scene, colouring choices, the operating room looking like a profession operating room and not a room in run down building, Omiting the details and brutality of how fireflie treated Joel. How they never woke Ellie up to get her permission, how they never let her say good bye to surrogate father. All through the game they hint out how incompetant firefly are and joels distrust for them.
This all plays a role in joels mindset at the time, yes he was focused on saving ellie at all costs, you need to be in that situation, but o his perspective the fireflies were incompetant terrorists that were trying to find a cure, likely for their own ends and not for any altruistic cause, they entire game not only hints at that, but also joels distrust for them.
If joel thought there was a chance for a cure and it would save humanity, he may have took it on the chin. But the most selfish option joel could have did, was let Ellie die in that situation. I mean he risked his life against insurmountable odds to save her, that doesnt strike me as selfish.
The OP was trying to show that ND changed these details purposfully to make joel look unjustified in his actions, to make abby more accessible and not appear like the dumb as rocks 2 dimensional character she was. They wanted people to like the character that just did this horrendous thing, so they put more resources into trying to get the players to see things from her perspective.
She was not hated because she killed joel, or because she looked like a dude, she was hated because she had no depth. Someone of average intelligence would have though, hmm maybe joel wasn't the vicious psychopath he was, maybe the cure wouldnt have worked, this should have been made even clearer when he saved her life, but still she brutally murders hmm, Neagan style.",0.6001734733581543

comments discussing characters of the game,"My hot take is that Blonde Blazer should've been the only romance in the game. Personal biases aside, Blazer is just objectively a better romantic partner. She's honest, supportive, and actually communicates her feelings. In comparison, Invisigal has a truckload of emotional issues that she needs to deal with before she can even think of starting a relationship with someone. What she really needs is friends and to work on herself.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I was replaying the game, and just got to that part and immediately had to take break.
Robert can fight the Skittles Squad with one arm, with absolutely no hesitation or choice to back off.

He can singe eyebrows/break a tooth off Flambae, with no regard, and taking the piss. It's obvious Robert is not a pushover or goody-two-shoes, even though he's obviously a good man.
But Courtney can insult him, mock his dead dad, say he's not a hero, sexually harass him at work, embarrass him, disobey direct orders, get a civilian hurt and let a perp escape, and then outright assault Robert. And when you complain to BB, he immediately tells her to drop it and defends Courtney, saying he was asking for it.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I am gonna start off by saying that the game as a whole was pretty meh, with the last episode being pretty weak.
But I dont think the character that actually mattered(Robert), really got shafted by Invisigal, Robert cared alot about the legacy of the mechaman and tied his self worth to being a hero. But obviously with the story Robert finds something else he can be proud of, turning criminals/convicts into heroes, and having them find their own self worth. Especially with mentoring the second main protag, Invisigal.
I don't think Invisigal being the most important character is inherently a bad thing. This might be a hot take, but I think the game wouldve been better focusing MORE on her. Dump the stupid romance options with Invisigal, keep it strictly mentor/student between Robert and Invisigal.
I feel as though trying to spread the screentime between all of the program's heroes would just be a bit pointless? Waterboy's and Phenomoman's little arcs they get are fine. But trying to do it with all the other program heroes? Like yes we get it you also have personal problems, you are in the program, we know.
We also see an example of the devs trying to spread screentime to another hero ending up as a waste of time, Flambae. Like I said above(edit: i didnt say that above dumbo), he has a personal conflict with his mentor that also revealed himself as the hero that put him behind bars, and tries to kill him. Resolved with just a joke. Like I get the message. Robert is paying for his past, just like the program heroes are, invisigal says that, but the payoff couldve been better.
I just think the side characters should be treated as such, side characters. Is really what im trying to say I guess. I might be wrong idk.",0.6209507584571838
comments discussing characters of the game,"I get what you're saying, and I actually agree with a lot of it. I definitely think they should've dropped the romantic aspect between Robert/Invisigal, and while I do like Waterboy/Phenomaman, the game was already spreading itself thin with the original characters. Adding those two just made things even worse.
Also, it's funny you say that ""side characters should be treated as such, side characters"" because that's sort of my problem. Invisigal technically is a side character. It's easy to forget, but this story is Robert's, or at least it was before she entered the picture. The fact that a side character had more character growth and more plot relevance than the main character is just bad writing.
And if you really need to make her a romance option, at least make her the only one. I feel so bad for Blonde Blazer fans because the writers really set her up for failure by forcing her to compete with Invisigal.",0.6420119404792786
comments discussing characters of the game,"Loved the game but they definitely should have given more screentime to other characters, especially Blonde Blazer. Picking Invisigal over Blazer basically screams you love a toxic relationship and would rather have a girl that stalks and abuses you, that you can't trust, over someone who would protect you, give you space and everything else you basically need in a healthy relationship. I find it funny how many people picked Invisigal over Blazer and it basically shows that most men who play this game would prefer someone who only wants them, even though they'd betray you and lie to you, spy on you and stalk you. Anyways that was my take of the game. I still liked Invisigal as a character a lot. She has a good arc, but she's basically the ""I can fix her"" type that all the men who play this game goon over.
Just wish Blazer and other characters had more screen time.",0.6757030487060547
comments discussing characters of the game,"Okay. Let‘s see if this works… okay it does not. I‘ll split it in two parts then. Analysis 1:
I think some of the things she does in the episodes are fine. Episode three and four are a bit annoying, but it’s not because she get‘s this attention, it‘s because other characters don‘t. You‘d need this amount of interactions with her, Coupe, Sonar and ideally some of the other characters as well. There are little tidbits here and there, but not enough. It also sucks that they treat cutting someone as a decison your characters is supposed to support but most players will not want to do that as there seems to be little reason why you should, since you‘re not even cutting based on any real (miss)deeds, they just pretend they do and then actually make you choose between two characters who (with your knowledge) at that point are not better or worse than most other people on the team. This could have been circumvented by having Blazer forcing you more directly to cut someone, but it would take tension out of a later situation and create conflict with Blazer they likely didn‘t have time to resolve.
Meanwhile, episode five is totally fine because she does not really get more moments to shine there than any of the other team members. It only seems like she does, because you did not list the things other characters do: Flambae is the focus of the entry point when Robert is training by lifting weights, has flashbacks to his fight with Flambae, almot hurts himself but is luckily saved by the very same. Later at the bar, Flambae get‘s to sing a very amusing song which is actually also the song for the credits of episode 5. Prism, Punchup and Golem get some attention during the bar fight and whether you reveal your identity or not, the spotlight is on Flambae being sceptical or even on him attacking you but being stopped by Golem and (depending on your choices) Malevola or Waterboy. Tldr: Invisigal is not overly prominent for most of episode five.
Episode six imo suffers from the way you do not get to interact with most characters during the party and (depending on your choice one episode earlier) the way they may not even be present for your trestrun of the new powersource for the suit. You could argue that this is a problem dating back to episode two because they specifically make it so that only Invisigal is set to know your identity out of all the members of the team, but I‘d say it‘s that there is not opportunity to spend some time alone with other characters between you waking up in the infirmary and the end where she goes alone. You could argue that it would be better to have another character do it then, but you need at least some kind of personal setup for it to be a dire moment.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I was so SO sure blonde Blazer was going to be a villain. Everything seems set up to go that way. She appears at your lowest moment as this beacon of hope and not only saves you but offers you a job at a hero related company where he can mentor others and as a little added bonus they'll fix his suit completely free of charge! Wow what a deal! Almost too good to be true!
And it should have been too good to be true. Blonde Blazer could have been a really interesting character in so many ways. Shes the head of a for profit hero dispatching company, I have to imagine that could attract some bad actors. And we see Robert lives in relative poverty despite being a hero and I bet Blazer doesn't because she at least gets a paycheck. Wouldn't that have been more interesting to see? Hero work doesn't pay so she needs to find a way to make it pay, she needs to employ heroes somehow. It could have just been a practical thing, siding with shroud or even an ""anonymous investor"" she has misgivings about but needed the money so she takes a contract to rebuild the suit and the power source.
I've harped on dispatch a lot recently and I need to stop because ultimately I'm disappointed with the game but I can't change what it is. And to me, what it is is a first draft. I was sure blonde Blazer was a villain because contextually, given everything surrounding her, it would have been the obvious more interesting way to take the character. Contrived but set up. But every character says exactly what they mean, no nuance, no tricks or lies. It's power rangers level morality with swearing and blood to get a mature rating.
I feel like there were two sets of character writers in this game: one wrote stereotypical trope characters but pushed them to different extremes to make characters, leaving them feeling either bland or 10 on their tropes scale but demonstrably their own characters (phenomaman, waterboy, Robert, Blazer, sorta coupe, Shroud before the final battle), and then one writer who can write one character type, that being snarky, over quippy, swearing, disaffected chatters with rough histories and chips on their shoulders with an overly sexual sense of humor who have a good heart underneath and really just need friends (Invisigal, sonar, malevola, punch up, prism, flambe, gollum, Chase, Shroud in his final scene). But it all suffers from a lack of actual depth and character motivation. Everyone says exactly what they think and mean, it's like you're meant to only be half paying attention. Can't lose anyone and have unclear motivations!
It's almost good. But the ways it fails makes it incredibly frustrating as someone who really does enjoy the narratives of games.",0.6292714476585388

comments discussing characters of the game,"Civilians in Jackson were safe, but the world was still dangerous place. They killed Infected during patrols. It's stated they had bandits problem in the first game - which is abandoned concept, because you can't read anything in patrol journal about them. The point is - people still had to be careful, especially the chosen ones for patrol. That's why I matched that topic with Joel. I would say they abandoned bandits concept only to make Joel's change more credible. You shouldn't change things confirmed in 1 game to make excuse in another.
Like I commented about Tommy later
""my problem is that tlou part II was bad with giving clues to the player. 1st game was pretty good with that - we knew why Marlene was torn between what to do and why it was hard for her. She had friendship with Anna, but she was a leader of the fireflies and everyone else wanted to sacrifice Ellie. We know why Joel agrees to transport Ellie - it was Tess' deathwish. We know why Joel saved Ellie. It's not hard to explain characters' motives. With tlou part II Tommy's case it's not the only one. Also while I can agree with your reasons why you believe Tommy's change makes sense, it could also go different direction. He could also be character, who lost everything by seeking revenge, so he doesn't want it anymore, because he sees that destructive force. He was a Firefly, he spent time with Joel being on both sides, so for me, he should be stronger mentally than Ellie.""
Also when we have Ellie, who slowly looses herself by time with Tommy we have to guess. He wants to go back to Jackson, 1 year timeskip and he is whole different person. He still had Maria when he came back, his experience and Ellie close to Jackson. He visited her and Dina even in his bad state. For me it all feels rushed to add some drama at the end.
With Ellie the problem is hat, after last flashback her loosing herself is justified less than before. The moment we get to know she talked to Joel one last time, her guilt about Joel becomes less serious in my eyes.
My point with all of this is that the game is pretty bad at story telling. It can't keep with its motive that much also. It gives reasons for Ellie to loose everything (even though I still don't agree with the path they choose), but with Tommy we have to guess and use headcanons for it to make sense. Like someone else said, gameplay makes us kill countless npc, only for attack us again if we let them live. It makes us believe that we can't spare anybody. Ellie kills hundreds of npcs but gets trauma after killing people with name in self defence. (Tbh after seeing her in Pittsburgh and against David I don't buy, that she cared that much). The story is meant to tell us ""revenge is bad"", but does it? WLF vs Scars/Seraphites war. Issac is dead, but WLF was a huge group, they still probably won the war and chose a new leader. Abby firstly decides to life Seattle, not because she has enough of war, but because of Owen and also because she would be treated as deserter if she stayed. Ellie's desire to get revenge on Abby is the reason why she lives later. That's why the story is full of inconsistencies. We can argue by giving our interpretations, but that's still interpretation and what game tells with its story. It wasn't a problem in 1st game - we knew reasons, we knew the game's topic, we could only debate if we agree with characters' beliefs etc.",0.6107231378555298
comments discussing characters of the game,"There’s other stuff I can add about the character development and where it’s lacking in this game like you mention but as I’m working I’ll just chime in on the Tommy bit you mentioned about why he wants to find Abby again at the end and why it makes sense to me.
I took Tommy’s change to be one of loss and bitterness. Tommy had Joel, Ellie, Maria, Jackson and by extension Jesse who he was clearly close with, and his shooting/ ability as a fighter/ being able to protect people.
On his return from Seattle he has none of those things. Joel and Jesse are dead. Ellie has moved out from Jackson, him and Maria have separated. One of his legs is crippled and he is blind in his shooting/ dominant eye so can’t even shoot/ patrol/ protect Jackson like he used to.
He has nothing left and this resentment has obviously built within him since returning that it is all Abby’s fault. He is left with nothing because she came to his town and murdered someone.
If they had just left Seattle without Abby coming across them I don’t think he would have gone out hunting Abby again. I think he knows he caused enough damage and that they are as close to “even” as they could get. But the damage he receives in the theatre brings out an almost petty sort of need for revenge/ to be the winner/ not lose to that person again. I think he loses all meaning of “justice” and wants Abby dead for his own ego as much as anything else.",0.6142396926879883

comments discussing characters of the game,"Nah this all seems like bad interpretations of the story. Moving Abby's storyline into DLC and making it completely irrelevant to the main story doesn't make any sense. Then Ellie doesn't have a story at all because her story revolves around what Abby did. What would the main game even be about then?
Ellie said she would start to forgive Joel, but she hadn't already forgiven him. Abby robbed her of that chance to fully forgive him and live a life with him into the future. So yes, she's angry at Abby for that and angry at herself for taking so long to forgive him, because she did still love him.
She wanted her life to matter by saving humanity. Now she's just living in Jackson and surviving day to day with no purpose. Before the revenge hunt she was likely bored and had no direction in life, especially since she wasn't talking to Joel. Yes, it wasn't ever clearly communicated, and Joel only killed the Fireflies because they wouldn't let him take Ellie away, but the situations are meant to be complicated - no one is the good guy, it's all just fucked up and complicatedly human.
You don't actually explain what was bad about Abby, you just tell us your bad fanfic about what you wanted them to do instead. There's nothing to talk about here.
As I said, no one is the good guy. Nora is just protecting her friends like everyone else. She's biased and believes Joel deserves what he got because he hurt her and her friends (Abby). That's all it is, it's not that deep. You're trying too hard to treat every character like a rational robot when they're not, they're actually realistic, flawed people.
The side characters were kinda lame I can give you that, and arguments about Ellie's personality maybe have some basis - but she did grow up significantly and we don't know what other experiences shaped that, people can and will change a lot in such an intense environment. We also only really see her post-Joel's death which isn't exactly a normal situation, so it's hard to really analyse her. She's not gonna be cracking jokes when she's at the absolute lowest point of her entire life.
Tommy's inconsistently also threw me, it felt unnecessary, and Ellie deciding to go after Abby against Dina's wishes would have hit harder without Tommy guilting her honestly. I agree with this.
Infected just aren't important to this plot and that's ok. It's post-post-apocalypse and their existence is more routine, it makes sense. Shoehorning infected into the story wouldn't have helped anything.",0.6109405755996704

While gameplay is subjective, I found OP's attempts at calling the gameplay of especially TLOU2 uninnovative and the likes. I personally found the fluidity of TLOU2's gameplay and grittiness of it to be exceptionally brutal and ""enjoyable""(I felt uncomfortable at times, especially in certain significant fights, but it was enjoyable in the manner that I could not put the controller down). What I found incredibly genius about it that only caught on in later playthroughs is just how much the gameplay is tied into the story. The story and the gameplay evolve together.

Joel is just some Liam Neeson character on a kill spree. It's just not truly effective because there's nothing that Joel offers us along his arc. He doesn't become batman, a Phantom Thief, or even Rick Blaine. None of those things. He's just a miserable character that grows to accept his misery. He's not 1/10th of a Sojiro Sakura type of father figure, who also knows loss but doesn't wallow, shows growth and contributes to the character development of much better protagonists in a much grander arc.
But you made my point exactly. Sarah is simply a mundane catalyst, and that is passable for the simple story that is trying to be relayed to us. It just cheapens and is cheapened by the fact that Ellie exist a few minutes later.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Very insightful and attentive notes.
In a show, I love action and good writing/storytelling and Pedro pascal (obviously lol). I only played the first half of this game a long time ago but was also only recently told to watch this/reminded it exists - and I love it.
As I think you mentioned before, most game adaptations to shows suck. I was pleasantly surprised, to put it mildly, with how seriously this story was taken when it came to the show. The infected are actually kinda scary, and I've been on edge for more jump scares than actually occur. Not a love for me, but I'd imagine that was the goal of the producers to some extent, so props to them. It makes you think and anticipate within and beyond each moment represented, and I appreciate that very much. Good on them.
Anyway. I'm drunk and it's late. You're a pretty good writer, op, if you cared to edit. Don't judge cause I refuse to either especially right now. Trying to give a compliment.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Unlike I imagine many of those on this subreddit I actually enjoyed the game. There is a number of criticisms I see cropping up again and again. I would like to give my reasons why I disagree with those criticisms. I would like to point out that I in no way see myself as either being right or wrong. People are entitled to their own opinions and all media including videogames is subjective.
Joel's death
I know many people were upset not only that Joel died in the game but the manner of his death. I personally was unsure how the game would work without the central dynamic of the two main leads. However I think this desicion worked and his death served the narrative. His death was a direct consequence of the events at the end of the first game. I also know Joel giving his real name is a source of contention and many think this goes against what we previously know about his character. One thing to note though is that it is actually Tommy not Joel that first gives this information. Also from what is suggested about Jackson they seem to take on new recruits and members to their community. We also know they would take in visitors as Joel explains that he traded some of his belongings for coffee at the end of the game. It could therefore be taken that Joel and Tommy are perhaps less guarded and more trusting as a result.
I also believe Joel's death needed to be brutal and bloody and for Ellie to witness it to give her the motivation for her revenge. I also disagree with the notion that Ellie somehow had time to shoot Abby when she first encounters her. It must have taken at least a second or two for her to realise exactly what was happening by that time she'd already been disarmed and incapitated. If she did have chance to fire her weapon it would have been no guarantee of hitting Abby and may have been as likely to shot Joel instead. 
Ellie's personality and relationship with Joel
Many have cited Ellie's change in attitude and behaviour from the first game as somehow proof of bad writing. However I disagree. When Ellie met Joel she was 14. In this game she is 19. In that time she has been through a lot. She obviously suffers from PTSD. How many people in real life have a change of personality during their adolescent and teenage years. 
Also think back to ending of the first game Ellie knows that Joel is lying but goes along with it. This must have weighed down on her and over time as she became older we see she didn't want to be a part of the lie anymore. That she resented Joel for this is understandable. How many people resent their parents in real life for far less. Even though Ellie and Joel had a difficult relationship they obviously cared for one another. Ellies tattoo includes the moth symbol from the guitar that Joel gifts to her and this would suggest a deep connection. At the end of the game Ellie wants to forgive Joel. 
The ending of the first game
Another critism is often of the supposed retcon of the first game. I personally don't understand this. There's a minor visual change sure but otherwise it just gives a backstory to the surgeon and gives the view from the perspective of the fireflies. I know that many people feel this demonises Joel but I disagree. The ending of the first game wasn't never meant to be black or white and the staff involved in the first game have stated so. It's meant to be an ethical dilemma. I don't think The Last of Us Part 2 or the original game has ever intended for Abby or Joel or anyone for that matter to be viewed as simply good or evil more that people are capable of both acts and who you agree with depends on your perspective and to consider the opposing view. 
Also as to whether the vaccine would have worked or not is again a pointless argument. It may have done it may not have. The argument is more regarding the ethics. Were the fireflies right to take one life to save possibly countless other? Should they have had a frank and open discussion with Ellie and Joel first? Was Joel right to save Ellie against her wishes and should her have told her the truth after? There is no right or wrong answer that's why the 'runaway tram dilemma' is still taught in ethics. 
Abby
I think most of the criticism is aimed at Abby. I get why she wasn't loved by everybody for obvious reasons. She wasn't my favourite character but I was able to understand her motivations. I know some people view her as a psychopath specifically because of her torture of Joel but again I feel this reduces things to good vs evil which is too simplistic. Also many other characters have committed torture and in the case of Tommy and his time before the events of the game we don't know the context of this. It has also been stated that Abby feels no remorse, but she mentions on occasion she can't sleep. Although not as immediately obvious she like Ellie may have PTSD. 
Also on the subject of body type, yes Abby isn't your average female but it is possible to have her physique. I know obviously it's a post apocalyptic world but in a game where a man (Tommy) survives being shot in the head and where Joel in the first game survives impaling himself on a metal bar with minimal medical intervention then it's far from the least plausible thing. Every fictional story or narrative surely requires some suspension of disbelief otherwise you can sit and poke holes in pretty much any story. 
Go woke, go broke
This brings me to my final point. Some people, and I am aware this a very small but often vocal minority of people simply refuses to engage with the game because of its focus on female, gay and transgender characters. They like to make out that is some kind of conspiracy. I'm pretty sure it isn't but maybe it should be until we get to a point whereby when a game focuses on a narrative from a perspective of the female or gay characters people aren't angrily bashing the phrase 'go woke, go broke' or 'SJWs' frantically into the comment sections of the internet. 
I say this as as a white straight male myself. Better representation is needed in videogames to better represent the general population and gamers as a whole and in turn this should make more interesting stories. 
Thanks for reading (if you did). I would like to reiterate I in no way consider my views to be correct, just my opinion. ",0.6258171796798706

How is it possible that you people understand so little and still try to make an argument out of it? IT DOES NOT FUCKING MATTER WHO THE PROTAGONIST OF A STORY IS. What does matter is whether beloved characters are redefined or pushed out of existing franchises to make room for the next agenda to push.

Learn to read.
Also interesting that I am narrow-minded, considering that there are quite a number of diverse games among those I enjoyed the most. Like Gone Home, Life is Strange, the TWD series. Hellblade and Horizon and probably more than I can remember. You can even find JJ Macfield there, a game where you play a trans character.
Enjoying those games or being open minded like you call it does not mean I need to accept a sub-par story because devs felt the need to pander to the SJW cloud. Give me diverse, good characters and we are fine. Give me idiotic characters like Abby in your agenda to create the perfect, non-sexualized character and twist the story to make her and her brain-dead sidekick sympathetic then the game can fuck off.
No one ever says 'why is this dude banging all these chicks? I know he's straight but do they have to make it so obvious' and remember when people got all pissy when Battlefield had playable female characters.
And Battlefield was hurt by that pandering. Also, what is this nonsense about ""that dude""?

comments discussing characters of the game,"Haha. Joels death was so fucking lazy and contrived.
The very first teaser, where Ellie is singing and we only see Joels boots as he walks through rooms of death, it was so fucking obvious he wasn't part of the scene but in Ellie's head.

comments discussing characters of the game,"""Also from what is suggested about Jackson they seem to take on new recruits and members to their community. We also know they would take in visitors as Joel explains that he traded some of his belongings for coffee at the end of the game""
Stuff like this is basically the whole reason why theres just ""game of this generation"" and ""the worst trash of this generation"" people. Like you can completely take every little piece and many times use your imagination/interpretation to say ""no no, this is because this and that"" and say that those who dont do that are just to dumb, ignorant or even just resent the game because theyre bigots/homophobes. Or you can just see what actually happened on screen, like what actually was and is and judge it by that.
Id say though that the necessity to piece stuff together or even interpret and imagine things to a story or game is a bad thing. For example, I recently red a comment on the Morpheus vs Neo fight scene in the Matrix, which said that the sparring program was designed so that Morpheus wins, so Neo landing a hit was already the sign that he is the chosen one. Because he broke the rules of the world he was in.
Now the thing is, this is just interpretation, which imo makes the scene even better, but, it is not necessary, the scene just worked perfectly. But if something is in question, and you need to interprete and piece stuff together to make it work flawlessly, its flawed.",0.6519113779067993
comments discussing characters of the game,I never said that people who don't like the game are dumb or ignorant or homophobes. I'm sure some are but I don't think that is representative of people in general that didn't like it. I disagree though I don't think everything needs to be spelled out. I don't need to know exactly Ellie and Joel got to Jackson after the death of Henry in the first game or how exactly Ellie managed to find medical supplies to save Joel. Sometimes you just gotta accept subtext. Otherwise if everything was spelled out films would be like 10 hours long.,0.6192789077758789
comments discussing characters of the game,"I wasnt saying you do, this was just to sum up how this whole situation in the fanbase came upon based of your post.
And this isnt about spelling everything out, its about what a character did contradicts to much to what he wouldve done in the original material, and in order to oppose the criticism that comes from that contradiction people use words like ""it seems that"" and bits and pieces of information and make it work. The Neo/Morpheus scene didnt need that interpretation because it wasnt in question, the interpretation just added to something that already worked, the ""it seems Jackson is looking for recruits"" interpretation is needed in order to make it work.
And beyond that if information is too far away or disconnected from what is happening a piece of entertainment becomes more of a piece of work because the audience has to reach so far to add it into the event that is happening. Its like people become detectives to make sense of what happened or is happening.
Tbh I dont think that if someone is truly honest about this game it cant be defended as being good overall. All these interpretations arent what the game is, but again, theyre needed to make it work, so it doesnt work in the end.",0.6478973627090454
comments discussing characters of the game,You make some good points but I only made this post to highlight how some things need defending because of what I perceive as being nitpicky. For example Joel supposedly acting out of character. I don't agree with this but can see how it is a valid criticism. Similarly with the dislike of Abby. However what I do find some reasons for disliking the game as needlessly critical. When people are adamant that the vaccine wouldn't have worked because 'vaccines don't work on infections' this is both scientifically inaccurate (I've seen a number of medical publications state research is being undertaken to see if vaccines could work against fungal infections to combat antibiotic resistance) and also overallyy critical. Also I feel the whole Ellie had time to shhot debate is also overally critical. All stories and narratives require some suspension of disbelief. I'm sure you could bring up any story or movie or whatever and no matter how well received it is and you could poke holes in some part of its logic,0.6451070308685303
comments discussing characters of the game,"Yeah thats true I think. At some point the disappointment or even hate people have towards the game turned into a witch hunt for flaws.
But Joel not acting as he wouldve in the original material led to the most central turn of the story and the loss of his great character. Thats not nitpicking saying that this was just a bad way of initiating the whole story and total waste of his character.
And I dont think you could poke holes into the logic of the matrix to make it bad. I think that the whole ""human beings produce as much electricity as a battery"" premise isnt even real. But it doesnt have to be, the story, characters and theme will always be great. Like Agent Smith calling Neo Mr. Anderson throughout the trilogy, no hole in the given logic will make this not epic as hell.
And yeah the game is incredible when it comes to visuals and gameplay, no doubt, but storywise and the overall feeling is really miserable and actually so far away from the first game. Tbh I dont care if people like it, Im almost jealous because I just felt empty as hell. Like so many years in anticipation and than its just nothing.

comments discussing characters of the game,"It's funny, some days I'll be like ""fuck this game"" and other times I'll think it's not that bad. I am overall disappointed in the direction they took it all in but that doesn't make me hate on every single little thing about it or be nitpicky or prevent me from saying anything positive.
My biggest problem is probably Abby. I don't think she's a psycho, I get her, but I just cannot bring myself to care. I hate that they decided to do this little empathy experiment in the first place. She doesn't even feel like an actual character to me but a gimmick. The whole point is to get you to feel differently about her by the end and I dislike that idea to begin with, I don't know how to not be so self-aware of what they're trying to do with her. It doesn't help that they don't go about it in an organic way, it feels artificial and heavy handed. To me the game is basically and desperately saying ""Look, she's both Joel and Ellie combined into one!"" and as I said earlier there's just something gimmicky about that which rubs me the wrong way.
I definitely agree with you about Ellie's change and resentment of Joel, that I don't have an issue with. This game isn't very subtle a lot of the time and right at the beginning they have Joel singing to Ellie ""If I ever were to lose you, I'd surely lose myself."" Then Ellie loses Joel. And she begins to lose herself. It's kind of the point. She also tries to be like Joel at times and fails at it, she is literally trying to be someone she's not. She was already changed after killing David and then again at the end when it all turned out to be for nothing in TLOU. But I forget that only male characters are allowed to be dark, broken and brooding. Their stoicism and sombreness never keeps them from being likable, interesting, complex and all that jazz!
Her feelings towards Joel also make sense if you even bother to look at it from her POV. She is condemned to just live with her survivor's guilt knowing that something could have been done about it back then. A nice and safe community and comfortable living isn't just going to make her forget that the cordyceps infection is still a thing and she is immune to it. She has been carrying that guilt with her since she got bit and has to continue to.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I agree with a lot of this. I loved the representation in the game. If someone is offended by it even though it isn't a part of the story and doesn't detract from it, then they are jerks. And Abby's body is certainly possible even in that world in 4 years although extremely unlikely, but given the greater than life characters it's excusable. And the whole ""vaccine for a fungus doesn't work"" thing is silly because it was just a ""cure"" and you're supposed to believe it.
My gripe is that the fireflies were shown as incompetent and as terrorists but the second game retconned that and made them seem good. Think of how they beat Joel when breathing Ellie back in Salt Lake City. And how disgusting the room was and how angry Jerry looked. I personally always shot him in the foot which shouldn't have killed him (and doens't even register as a kill in the stats apparently) yet the game retcons that gameplay decision as well. I would sneak past all the guards yet Pt2's intro shows a bunch of dead bodies. The first game's ending was morally ambigious but the ONLY way fireflies are shown in part 2 are as good guys.
I do agree Ellie being different in the game is okay because she's on a downward spiral and also growing up as a teen, especially with the Joel context (both his death and the Fireflies thing). The way they handled their relationship was perfect in my opinion.
But overall, i think the problem was that they used the story to tell messages about not judging people, perspective and empathy, and forgiveness and acceptance rather than telling a cohesive story. The disorienting flashback structure, the emotional fatigue and self-indulging misery and violence with zero payoff or saving grace were just too much. I still think the whole experience was engaging and would give the game an 8, which is a far cry from the 10 I'd give the first.
And the big lies that Ellie is the only playable character and no killing dogs and Joel being there were dismissable in isolation, but together, they make it clear that ND was afraid to tell this story because they wanted to use nostalgia from the old game and a vision of a game that never existed to market it, which is and will always be dishonorable. I do think the leaks were unfortuante as they shaped a lot of people's expectations already. Fortunately I didn't know anything yet I don't love the game either.
Lastly, the way ND and its actors and employees are hiding behind smokescreens and using silly awards like ""most completed game"" and extremely misleading statistics and putting themselves above others as morally and intellectually refined people who are able to understand the deep profundity of this masterpiece and bashing everyone who disagrees with intellectual dishonesty doesn't sit right.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Pretty much my experience. Like, I could've written that myself including the Hillcrest part.
Pacing of the game is part of why people were ""depleted"" at the end but that has been discussed before so I just tried to stay on my specific point. I think the fact that the game is beautiful, and the cinematic gameplay is attractive makes some people not pay attention to the story itself. We have to be objective, we all don't have the same ""priorities"", for me storytelling in this game is my number 1 priority, graphics and gameplay come in a clear second place. Butchering the story and characters that I care about can't be compensated with nicer graphics and gameplay. What NC tried to push as a ""revolutionizing"" story h driven games and pushing boundaries was nothing but an amateurish push for moral lectures. I remember a verse from an old song that goes something like ""if someone steals but then sacrifices himself (like in, sacrifices his life to save others), what should we do?"" And I can hear NC in the back, ""stealing is wrong!""
NC tried to ""push"" way too many boundaries, from both technical and moral points of view and the result was a beautiful but chaotic mess. If he had picked one maybe, just maybe, it would've been a different story (pun intended!)

So the counterargument was people pulling out characters who were written with a slightly more modern cadence on purpose (Alistair) or joke one-offs (""I like big boats, I cannot lie"") to prove that, actually, Dragon Age has ALWAYS been written by this, HATER, and it's easy to pull a single line out to make your point, but it's a lot harder to make your point about the vibe in totality, right?

The game otherwise portrays Solas caring about elven immortality as more lip service than something he really cares about, and it emphasizes Solas' ruthlessness as a dominant character trait that seems sort of unwilling to analyze its own logic.
It generally got rid of all of his more complicated (and sympathetic) motivations, and I can think of only one real conversation that even tries to bring up elven mortality, and not in a way that tackles the moral complications, just in a 'huh, weird to think about, right?' way.",0.6162583231925964

Everything was watered down to the point where it didn’t even feel like we were in Thedas anymore.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Another top level comment bc I can't stop myself and it looks like you don't want me to: I was very new to video games when I played DAI, despite being an older nerd. I played my first modern video game during quarantine, when my roommate held my hand and walked me thru Horizon Zero Dawn. So, after I loved it, and played it a couple times, the sequel had just come out - so I played Horizon Forbidden West and I also loved it. I didn't know I was getting a new hobby, but then she showed me how to play Dragon Age Inquisition and wow I was hooked. For me, it was so great having someone around who new about the first two games so I could just ask her about the history of the world and she just knew it, like it was real. I played a brunette human warrior because I am not very good at video games and it seemed like the easiest thing I could button mash my way through. I couldn't believe how big the maps were! And I knew there were different outcomes depending on what I did or said, but I didn't look up the alternatives. I just made the decisions for my character and let the pieces fall where they may. I romanced Blackwall the first play through, and the shock I felt when he left Skyhold the night after we slept together! The romance in the game wasn't something I knew about before hand, but I really came to care about it. I played again, as a male dwarf and romanced Cassandra, and boy was that hard! Flowers, poetry, the works! But that's also my experience in life as a bisexual. You do hafta put more work in for the ladies. Well, I do anyways.
So, I waited a while to play Veilguard. I knew everyone else had like 10 years in between games, so I took my time. I played Dragon Age 2, the one on the Xbox with Hawke, and it was interesting, but I didn't make it all the way through. Busy with life, etc. Like 6 months ago I saw a used copy of DAV in gamestop for like $16 so I bought it. I made sure I felt like I was finished with Inquisition, and I started Veilguard with tempered expectations but a lot of hope. It was very shiny, very pretyy, and the hair made my character look like a Disney princess, which I kind of liked, but it felt a little out of place in Thedas. Nevermind, I said. Its just character design. I was excited to see Scout Harding, devastated when Varric got hurt, but I soldiered on. I was Rook, a spunky Veil Jumper, who restarted that section of the game because I didn't know everyone else in that faction had face tattoos, so I went a got some. So I would fit in. I'm trying to enjoy this game on its own terms, but every time I go to talk to a companion at the Lighthouse, Bellara is there, already chatting them up. Why do I feel competitive with one of my own companions? Is it a mechanic of the game? No. Its just fucking weird. So, I don't want to romance anyone because it feels awkward, on top of that, everyone talks like a YA character at the beginning of the book. Which is fine for people who like that, I think, but I don't read YA books. I watched my partner play BG3, I saw the crazy sexual energy everyone was flinging around that game, and I don't want that either. I am not a prude person, but the romance in Dragon Age is more a cherry on top situation for me. But it felt like that's all the writers of the game cared about. This write up about the development hell illuminates a lot for me, and it really feels like it was given to younger writers who had only written fanfic up until that point.
I say to myself, I'm just gonna focus on the main quest. I won't try to make friends, I'll just solve this Solas thing and put him to rest once and for all. I picked up the controller again, i forget what point it was at, but the game basically said, 'if you want to progress the story, you need to do companion side quests now.' Like, could there be a clearer sign that its not for me? I like the look of it, I like the mechanics enough. Maybe I'll try again in like a year. For the meantime I purchased Mass Effect legendary edition for like $20 and I have made it thru two of those games so far. I started ME3 last night. Its going REALLY well, but they are super hard. Even on easy mode, I still had to really try.
I also restarted DAI with a new character. I love reading all these comments and hearing everyone else's experiences. It is better to suffer together.",0.6055587530136108
comments discussing characters of the game,"First of all, amazing write up and very apt description of all the drama and minutae of the dragon age history!
The thing about veilguard is that it isn't a bad game on its own, and I had a blast playing it. I appreciated the full lean into real time combat rather than the janky tactical/action hybrid of the precious games, the art and music were gorgeous, and it had some absolutely stellar sequences that themselves were on par with the previous games (the assault on Weisshaupt and the entire finale act were frankly some of the best work this series has had). And by Andraste it finally had a good character creator.
Unfortunately, art direction, combat, and set pieces were never the draw of dragon age for me and every fan I've known. What mattered to them (and me) was the choices, the potentially devastating unforseen consequences, and the fact that some members of the actual found families of disastrous bisexuals from all the previous games would react poorly no matter the decision you made. Dragon age never had ""correct"" or ""good"" decisions; where mass effect was all blue or red, dragon age was a spectrum of grey across the board.
What frustrates me is it had all the workings of a masterpiece, but was so clearly disadvantaged by EAs disdain for writers. The world building itself was still good, Solas and all the lore reveals were actually super interesting, and some of it had been speculated in the theorycrafting since before inquisition. You could have kept most of the story beats the exact same, and allowed Rook and the companions to actually react badly to events and characters (like say calling out the crows as murderers and child kidnappers) , and the game would have jumped at least another 1-2 points out of 10. Unfortunately the dialogue we got felt like it was written by HR.
Veilguard is a game that in any other franchise, or by itself, would have been received fine, if largely unnoteworthy. But in a series, and company, that made its mark on the industry through meaningful choices, political commentary, and superb character dynamics, it was doomed to fail the moment EA decided it wanted to appeal to everyone, by ultimately standing for nothing.",0.600377082824707

comments discussing characters of the game,"I followed season 3 in French as I am in France.
I have to say that after seeing all your comments before streaming the series I was extremely disappointed with season 3.
First of all, having so many main characters die in a single game was really complicated. I really liked the idea of the trans character and she who fought against two big guys and who was simply stabbed in the back I found it to be no good in concrete terms with her leg injury she wouldn't have gone very far anyway for the jump rope game but in my opinion she would still have more to fight for a long time...
The birth of the baby which takes barely 4 minutes even though it could be her and yeah everything is going well for the one giving birth left me completely speechless... I'm not even talking about the fact that suddenly the baby became a player in its own right, that was for me a decision to be scripted but completely stupid no but I mean what would it have cost them to take the baby and leave him out of all that which I think was just put as an argument script to make it seem like there were final decisions to be made with this baby, moral, ethical decisions and that's it.
I committed the mother's suicide because she killed her son. I also found that maybe not necessary, it wasn't the first time that there was a suicide and there I found it but completely stupid in the end... Especially a few seconds before the end of the game and she who had promised to take care of the baby, well maybe she wouldn't have gone very far for the jump rope...
I found the three games also really poorly handled and really not interesting compared to all the other games that there were in the other squid game seasons....
The final fight which pits the main character against the father of the child after having beaten everyone I found it very stupid also that suddenly he makes everyone fall from the second tower so that there is a sort of twist where there will be left at the end more than the main character and the baby... Frankly I found it rubbish even if it's supposed to be a bit of a message that there are some who won't give theirs to the devil we mustn't forget that the main character killed another character from composure because the rebellion had failed because of him but I found that stupid of him.
The VIPs don't contribute anything at all and their dialogue is just flat...
I think the death that will have had the biggest impact on me is especially the death of the trans character that I actually found, but it was really rubbish, she who was so strong and who was killed so simply, I found it totally rubbish...
With my partner I'm going to tell what happened in season 3 he told me well listen I'm not going to watch it because it doesn't seem good to me and I tell him listen you're not missing anything I understood the final message the rich always win the poor suffer but for me it was there could be a better ending all the same.
I don't think anything for the future of the series but I think it will just be Americanized and that will be without me...
I think like many that this series should have just remained one and one season which was more than sufficient itself to avoid falling into ridicule, pathos and easy",0.6052606701850891

You can tell your DM: “I don’t want my old character coming back, let alone in that condition. I won’t play her in that condition, and you will not either. I won’t consent to it. As someone who created this character, I want you to drop this storyline. I find it disturbing and unenjoyable.

Its one thing for the character to have to face consequences for their actions. Other PCs being upset with her after running away in fear is totally understandable and makes good roleplay. The DM continually raining more down when the characters have all made up is not.

Man, your DM sounds like the kind of shitty drama writer that gives cringe ass names to their novels just so that they can start and end every chapter with a title drop.
I won't lie, as DM, there are many times where I've wanted to cause Drama between PCs, or look smart by saying something like ""There will be consequences for this one very minor/easily forgetrable action, ooooohhh~ consequences"".
Yet in this case it appears your DM is trying to force your character to fit not only their vision but also pigeon hole your ability to react in character to the story's events.

I rebooted the character at a new table. I realized I hated that table. Everything that went on at that table that turned into a crisis or a blow up was a non fucking issue at the new table.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I am very lost on this one. If everything is taken at face value I am left wondering why you are still at this table but also what game system you are playing where you’re years in, your character gets mugged on the regular and isn’t wiping the floor with your average mugger by now.
“My DM loves punishing our characters” is a really good sentence for villainizing a DM for taking the time to give actions consequences but if your DM really is trying to write your character’s choices and feelings for you as you describe in the middle of your post that is a serious violation of boundaries and you should make that clear to him.
I am going to go out on a limb here and guess that since you’ve stayed at the table this long you probably would prefer to keep playing with that table. Assuming that’s the case you need to have a conversation with him about how you feel at the table with him right now, that it has felt like he has been trying to control your player character or force situations onto them that make you uncomfortable and that you can’t have fun (and thus won’t keep coming) if that keeps happening.",0.6083702445030212

comments discussing characters of the game,"Hard to say just from this story but I do feel your DM passing personal judgements on what is selfish etc. for your character rubs me the wrong way and makes it seem like he's out to get the players, rather then events in the narrative resulting in tragedy naturally. The DM's personal opinion of a morally dubious situation is generally not important and it would be better to not show any bias. Maybe I would tell a Lawful Good character their alignment may change if their actions seemed to lean chaotic or evil, but I wouldn't just say ""that's selfish of your character.""
In all seriousness, it sounds like you're still committed to this game, so assuming you don't want to quit despite that this story does raise a few red flags for myself and other commentors: A couple options would be to not have her come back as a PC at all and tell the DM you won't be playing the character and that she can be an NPC under his control.
Wth the terrible time in the woods she had, whatever that NPC might have done to punish her family is really not her fault and portraying it that way won't have the dramatic effect your DM might intend. She basically was given zero agency over her own fate, so it would be one thing if she got to live her own life and control her destiny but he kind of ruined that setup with going heavy on the edgy kidnapped in the woods thing.
Depending on how open your DM with feedback I would maybe bring some of this up before he brings her back.",0.627457320690155

If you want to stay at this table my recommendation would be to talk to the DM one on one, tell them quite clearly you aren't happy with how they've handled things and give specific examples and how they are effecting you and your ability to play the game. Make it clear, make it to the point. I recommend keeping things on a neutral level without getting overly emotional since that might be something your DM is wanting.
The fact the rest of the table isn't sticking up for you are speaking out how horrific the context of these situations are is also very telling to me. Does the DM treat their characters this way as well, or just yours?

The rest of the Reddit world seems to think the former and fully recommend bail. If that’s what you’re asking, yeah, I would never sign up for or tolerate this kind of game or be okay watching a fellow player be treated like this.
That said, if it’s the latter and you are “in to” this kind of story (and you might be, seems like you’ve been at it past what most people’s breaking point would be), then I will offer advice to keep playing the PC. She will be 25 when she returns, she has had bad, worse, and then horrifying (seven years of torture, hopefully off-screen). She will either emerge as a (self described) selfish, fearful, voiceless broken person…a character I would describe as unplayable…or she will realize that the arc of a hero often begins at rock bottom and she will have rebuilt her psyche in the fires as a tower of iron, brave, loyal, selfless, and able to confront the f***ery of a world/DM bent on punishing her for things that were not her fault. Overcoming is a great story…if a DM is willing to support you telling it.

Sure, I mess with my players and put them in morally grey areas but that's just to see how they would react if there is no real ""good"" choice.
If they don't make the choices I think they will, I don't punish them, I adapt like any DM should do.
I hope you find a better group/DM than this. Nobody deserves to have this treatment of their characters.
I wish you the best of luck. Hopefully future sessions and games will be much better than this.",0.6088014841079712

The thing about being a DM is that when a DM gives characters choices to make, they should be ok with whatever option the characters choose to make—and that goes for everyone at the table. Punishing a character/player for taking an option they gave for so long is wild to me.

comments discussing characters of the game,"If the rest of the party forgives/forgave her, the DM needs to get his or her head out of their backsides. It's fine to slip in occasional reminders of the cost or consequences of choices made, but only up to a point and only if it might help the player further develop their character. This is not that, though. I'm kind of amazed no one is willing to stand up for the character/you though, clearly the DM has issues, but it should make the other players feel awkward at the very least, that his focus on your character is so sadistic. Personally I'd just stop showing up, because they don't even deserve a heads up as to why you wouldn't want to.

The game like the show emphasizes character development, not all “zombies”. The story moved along while showing some normalcy after the world as we knew it ends. I and plenty others loved it.

I have mostly the same observations but i appreciated the story nevertheless.

Ellie becoming a horrifying wreck of a person unable to move on until the very end was a story that resonated very deeply with me. She did horrible acts (just like Joel did), but she manager to turn away at yet another last moment and save the last bits of humanity she had in herself.
Yes the story could have finished in Jackson on a tractor with potato but then it would have not been this story.

comments discussing characters of the game,"OP wrote
. I think it was completely unnecessary to tell the story that it told. Ellie finds no redemption, and in fact she makes her own life worse
TLOU has never been about redemption and pt2 is certainly not about that.
The fact that she makes her own life worse, is literally the point of the story. I get the OP wanted a ""happy ending"" for Ellie.
But that's one of the reasons this game is so loved and won so many awards. The story goes places you don't expect. The characters are majorly flawed and make bad decisions.
Doing shit you regret and that ruins your life, not many games or even TV shows or films are bold enough to write stuff like that which is realistic in terms of how humans actually behave.
Pt2 story is bigger, has more characters, and far longer than Pt1, but more importantly it's got some of the best written characters of all time in any game.
They turned Tommy from a side character to a critical driving force of the game's plot in a very unexpected way. Tommy's arc, the way he deals with Maria, it's just gut wrenching and too real.
A lot of the people who don't like the story of pt2, also wanted ""happier"" endings but that's just not how the world of TLOU works. It's more about telling stories that are true to the human condition.
Even Naughty Dog is careful not to do these types of stories too often.
Uncharted, the entire series is one happy ending after the next. While UC4 is undoubtedly the best written UC game and adds far more depth than 1-2-3 combined, it still ends with unrealistically happy notes all over the place.
the pressure on gaming and TV/Film to produce happy endings is real.

For me though, it actually felt like a somewhat happy and hopeful ending. It was hard watching Ellie sink so far into her grief and anger, but I was so relieved when she let Abby go.
The game could have ended at the farm, but personally I don't think it would have felt as conclusive. Ellie never got to make an active choice about killing Abby at that point, and I don't feel like her arc would have felt resolved without that. I don't think she would have given up on revenge at that point anyways - she only left Seattle because she basically had to, and she was still unable to deal with her grief at all.",0.6221562027931213

It in a way does kind of continue from the theme of the ending of the first game where Joel violently destroys humanity's only hope. I do feel like the first game had more uplifting moments in it though, where people found space to be human despite all the horror. The second one was scarcer with that, which made it feel more depressing.

Abby got lev in the end and looked pretty ok/happy before the kidnap. Also if Ellie feels all that, even more reason to have her kill Abby and then show how that didn't fix anything and she is still haunted.
IMO if the story they wanted to tell is ""revenge is never worth it"" they could've done a lot better but if the story is ""remember the characters you liked in the first game ? let me show you how evil they actually are so now you must hate them right ? Also please love this new girl i introduce"" then they told it well.

Then there was everything else: not enough depth to most of the new characters introduced, too many faux endings, characters ping ponging between whether they want revenge or not one too many times (looking at you, Tommy), Abby’s entire storyline and relationship with Lev was extremely rushed so they could create the Joel-Ellie parallel between the two etc. And the game seemed so caught up in its own misery, however intentional, that I just stopped caring about the conclusion.",0.6110712289810181
comments discussing characters of the game,"Played it twice, once on PS5 a few years ago and recently on PC. I completely agree with you on the whole Abby/ellie thing. I feel like I didn’t pay too much attention to the story back when I played it for the first time, or at least I don’t remember much, but this time around, I was completely on Abby’s side lol. Ellie completely lost herself and I think it’s to the game’s credit that she lost me too. I eventually found her not unlikable exactly, but in more of a “dude what the fuck are you doing” kind of way. Cool to see we have a similar perspective on that part of the game and it’s also cool to see genuine discussion about it.",0.6706151366233826
comments discussing characters of the game,"I equally love and dislike this game. It's great at story telling, action, movement, combat. But the switching of characters halfway through the game, starting over upgrading abby just dragged it down for me. I do admire the balls on them for what they did at the beginning of the game with joel. But the flow of the game doesn't work. Playing as abby had a purpose, and while i admire it. It didn't work. I hated playing as her. The combat and exploration is basically the same. But it just overstays it's welcome and makes the game feel too long. It's equally an amazing and not so amazing game.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Oh jeez here we go again. I appreciate how level headed your critiques are and I share a lot of them despite my conclusion being that it is a masterpiece instead. Main difference being that although I don’t think it “overstayed its welcome” it definitely is the type of story that a lot people can and will rightfully say that. I just think it was a slower burn.
I personally like to feel uncomfortable sometimes with stories. Kind of like watching a horror movie. I of course hated seeing Joel be killed gruesomely. I hated feeling like Ellie was turning into the bad guy very quickly. But those things made me feel something deeply in a way not many games do. I get the sense, not necessarily from you, but from other people that hated the game, that they don’t like to feel sad or mad about something that happens in a story. (Pertaining specifically to critiques of story, not gameplay)
I really liked how they made two factions (Ellie and Dina vs. WLF and Abby’s friends) that were harder than usual to decide how I felt about who was more moral, without it just being two factions that suck (Skyrim’s empire and storm cloaks). They both have flaws, and they both had very justified actions.",0.6142524480819702
comments discussing characters of the game,"At first, I thought the epilogue was a bit much. Thinking it was finally over, only for there to be a whole new chapter to get through, after everything that had happened, felt exhausting to me. Ellie pushing herself to go kill someone who spared her life twice, was frustrating.
However, I've finished the game two more times since then and I think I've come around to the finale. I don't think the story of the game would hit as hard. Abby sparing Ellie the second time and inadvertently saving herself from the slavers, felt like a pretty good loop around to what the game was getting at. It's not subtle or anything, but it worked for me. It feels like they reunited at the pits of hell for their final encounter. They both were on different trajectories but something more needed to push them to finally move on, especially for Ellie.
I think my only major gripe is that I wish there was just a little more of a dialogue exchange between them before or after their battle. I'm usually very pro 'show don't tell' but this felt like one of those rare times where I wish they just communicated a little. Some emotional release through their words. Even by the end of the game, they talked with each other. I don't mean pausing and having a conversation but maybe something akin to Joel and Ellie in the cabin. Moments like those are where I think TLOU shines and I think this game could've benefited from that. At least we got to see Joel and Ellie's final conversation though.",0.6036693453788757
comments discussing characters of the game,"This is exactly how I feel, reflecting on the game almost 5 years later. The last section is just unnecessarily cruel and horrible and takes everything too far. Like you said, the perfect ending was right there! It feels like the writers abusing their characters to, after ALL that violence and death and tragedy, add this whole extra section where Abby and Lev are literally enslaved 😭 and Ellie gives up the last piece of her soul.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I respect your opinion but I definitely disagree. I don't find Ellie unlikable as the game goes. For the most part she is forced into killing people. Nora is really the only questionable thing she does. And maybe leaving to go after Abby instead of Tommy.
But the rest of the kills are forced on her as they attack her in cutscenes.
I find her choice to leave Dina to be heartbreaking and also important. She didn't get any resolution from the conflict in the theatre and I think it's an honest and sad depiction of someone who has something good but can't move past her guilt. She ends up saving Abby which is a kind of redemption even though she almost kills her.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I love it for all the reasons you hate it. It shows a perfect example of the futility of revenge and hate.

comments discussing characters of the game,"You’re describing the intended reaction to the story.
I won’t disagree that the story is painful and emotionally draining, but it is the point of it.
The entire point of the Abby chapters is to slowly make you sympathize with the person you hated 20 hours ago, and even slowly start to disagree with Ellie’s decisions. By the end I liked Abby more than Ellie, which still feels crazy to type.
Then for Santa Barbara, I completely agree. At that point I was ready for the story to end because I was sick of the violence. I was emotionally exhausted and was praying for some sort of happy ending, namely the farm.
But again, that’s the intended reaction. The game wants you to hate all the killing by the end, and they want you to scream at Ellie for being so self-destructive. It’s a video game that made the players dislike killing bad guys by the end, even in Santa Barbara where the gang is cartoonishly evil.
I won’t disagree with the way you felt while playing, because I felt similar. However I do disagree that this means the story failed, it means it was a powerful story due to how effective it is at making us feel tough emotions.",0.6012665629386902

comments discussing characters of the game,"I think a lot of your criticisms are rooted in things that make the story uncomfortable and upsetting rather than “bad.”
I think Ellie became a very unsympathetic character as the game went on. I get that it's intentional for the themes of the game but it made her deeply unlikable by the end<
But what? how is that actually a criticism? Ellie is deeply unlikeable, she’s a tragic figure. Richard the Third is a good story and Richard being evil is the main thing that drives the plot forward in that story too. You can dislike that Ellie is a bad person, but I don’t accept that as valid criticism. A valid criticism might be that the way she becomes how bad is poorly written, or that her actions make no sense. But Ellie’s actions do make sense, it is easy to understand why she does what she does and how her trauma influences her decision making.
Personally I disagree that that other ending is better. The end of the game is actually the most hopeful part of the game despite how dark it is. In that moment, while bleeding out in the ocean far away from everyone she ever cared about, Ellie finally took control over her own life. She wasn’t being ruled by survivors guilt, or by guilt over not forgiving Joel. In letting Abby go Ellie regains her agency (which is the main theme of her character across both games).
If Ellie just stays at the farm she just suffers forever with no closure- that is unbearably bleak even by the standards of the rest of the game. Personally I like the hyper stylized ending where Ellie ends up in this hell on earth as a result of her own choices and yet there is still room for things to finally get better.
I get the game drags on for a while, I thought so too on my first playthrough, but after playing it a couple more times those criticisms have honestly all but vanished.",0.6187204122543335
comments discussing characters of the game,"I really like the game a lot, you’ve spoken my thoughts as well.

Still, well made/acted/etc. I don’t even mind all the Joel stuff, I think it grounds the world even more. The epilogue just really jumped the shark for me with a character doing something unrealistic for the sake of the plot.

I really, really, really love how the show took the opportunity to “fix it” where the game followed the trope. Despite the tragic backdrop of a post-apocalyptic setting, these gay men found love and got a happily ever after. They got to grow old together, which is rare to see for queer characters.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I happy you had your wow moment in the series, as someone who played the game but was much more into the story and the characters, especially Ellie and Joel of course, than into the gameplay elements, for me still episode 4 is the best by far. It doesn’t mean I didn’t like ep5, it was also great, just not as much as the previosu episodes. The only thing I didn’t like in this episode is the order of Kathleen’s arc.
The problem with Kathleen for me is that I believe her character would have been easier to understand and maybe even sympathize with, if we see her ruthless and blinded by revenge side first, like in ep5, and see her more human, doubtful and sad side second, like in ep4.
Interestingly, everyone says how much more the story progessed here than in ep4, but I felt the contrary. For me the main story in tlou1 is Ellie and Joel’s relationship, and therefore for me ep4 progressed much more in the most important point of tlou than any other episode.

comments discussing characters of the game,"The one I like about the ending scene in Part II, but I don’t see a lot of people talk about, is how they resolve their relationship.
Joel admits that he is willing to trade the whole world and humanity for Ellie, showing his love for her. This is nothing new to us, because we already know Joel loves her as a daughter. But Ellie, also says she wants to forgive Joel, despite she would never approve what he did. Which means no matter what he did, no matter how horrible he has been or how unforgiving he is, Ellie is still willing to forgive him. If you say they don’t have a mutual father daughter relationship previously, I think this is the moment they finally have.
I think this fits Neil’s own vision explained in the interview pretty well: “When we do the marketing we said first game is about love, second game is about hate. That’s not true. Both games are about love.”

comments discussing characters of the game,"The story has good themes, but in my opinion, the execution tanks all of it.
The game is full of manipulative tactics to make you like Abby (like Doggo scenes).
The structure of the story is all over the place, but it's heavily carried by acting.
In my opinion, the hook of the story is weak because it's based on retcon (remember, originally, the surgeon in PS3 version was a random bandit model that was never supposed to matter). Especially when no real doctor would kill his subject also quickly instead of making plenty of tests without killing her.
They should make you play as Ellie, travel with Abby, build bonds, and make Abby betray Ellie and kill Joel when she realised who he is.
Instead, we got this death scene at the start, which makes you automatically despise Abby, and then the game works to make you like her, but I just can't because why should I? Abby is a violent person who killed plenty of people on her way, and she never showed remorse. Ellie did plenty of times.
Her revenge arc consumed her to such a point that her actions led to the death of her friends. She tried to redeem herself by helping Lev, but it led to EVEN MORE DEATH that she is responsible for.
I don't mind you liking the game and supporting Abby, but she, in my eyes, is the most evil character in this universe that made hundreds of people die just because she couldn't let go. Ellie did let go at the end, and she LOST EVERYTHING for it.
Joel is considered a bad person for what he did, and he is. But Abby is worse, in my opinion.
Joel killed plenty of people and around 30 fireflies. Abbys actions took hundreds of lives because of all Domino effects that happened.
Abby got her revenge while Ellie never. I find it really dumb because she killed plenty of people on her way.

If my family member was a bad person and was killed by another bad person. I would still care about the family member more because I knew him. I knew Joel and Ellie. I didn't know Abby, and I don't care about her. In my eyes, she should rot in hell, but Ellie thought otherwise.

comments discussing characters of the game,This is my initial impression also. They make it seem like emotions are trivial when that is literally the main driver of the game. For me when I watch the game the very first time I noticed Eli didn’t care about passing away because like she said you’re the only person that has not left me or died which gives the impression her initial sacrifice is mostly because she’s got nobody. But now she found Joel,0.6392741799354553

This issue I have with this guys post is that superficially skimmed the whole story to make Joel a bad person and leaves a lot of information out. Quora answers are generally supposed to be very detailed to explain everything but here everything is just left out.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I agree with this. I think Naughty Dog played things pretty safe and one-note. At first glance the ending feels thought provoking and bold, but it could go much farther. Not unlike some approaches to comics/graphic novels, which some of the writers had backgrounds in.
A properly risky ending would be Joel being too late to save Ellie and having to live with that. Or actually believing the Fireflies and allowing them to go through with it. In both cases, then seeing the ambiguous outcomes you describe. 
Also the game's insistence on forcing the parallel to Sarah gets obnoxious and really stunts it in some ways. Give me something interesting with this setting.
Unfortunately the writers showed us with part 2 that they really are stuck in a particular, constricted concept of stories to tell within that setting. ",0.6239855885505676

comments discussing characters of the game,I kinda loved the Seattle section. This isn’t a “critique” but honestly I think the game could’ve used a LOT more levity.

comments discussing characters of the game,"It's not so much that I dislike the characters, I just found the leaned a little too far into an archetype that didn't make their conversations all that interesting. They made back and forth jokes in similar ways, they expressed concern in similar ways and their general demeanor felt safe. I'm more critical because the first game had characters like Bill, who was a cautionary tale for Joel, or David, who was the worst of those Joel had come across. It's also why I loved Lev so much. His conversations with Abby were unique to them and gave you different perspectives, while I think Dina felt like a bit of a safe thematic part of Ellie's story. I don't think she's bad, just a little flat for me. She's likeable and so was Owen, but I think giving them some more discerning and unique qualities, would've gone a long way imo.

“This moment between them is perhaps one of the finest examples of how language is used to convey how these two characters learn from each other, and it’s reflective of how Alexander and Bailey leaned on one another as actors. Several other moments in the game were brought to life through their improvisation—including a pivotal moment when Lev lashes out at Abby full of anger after the death of his mother and sister, inspiring Abby to tell him that she accepts him as one of her own people.“It felt like we captured lightning in a bottle,” says Druckmann, who initially envisioned Lev to be saddened and shocked.”",0.6046107411384583

comments discussing characters of the game,"I also just finished this game a week ago. I played part one on ps3 years ago, and never got the opportunity to play the second part until now.
Oh boy, this game is so incredible! I was aware of all the controversy, but I didn’t see any spoilers. I didn’t know what to expect, but this game exceeded all my expectations and I now consider it so much better than the first part! Don’t get me wrong, the first part is an excellent game, but the second part has made me feel things that no game or media ever has.
I cried a lot playing this game, not only on the cut scenes, but also during direct play. Both parts when Ellie and Abby fight were really emotionally hard to play. I ended up sympathizing a lot with both characters and I didn’t want any of them to kill the other.
I absolutely loved playing Abby. I loved her as a character, her muscular figure is so cool, and her backstory is very well told. She has some of the best parts of the game, especially the scenes with Lev, the skyscraper walk. And the rat king is the scariest fight of all the game. She is also the first one to break the cycle of hate, thanks to Lev. She refused to keep fighting Ellie, even when she killed all her loved ones.
It took Ellie longer, her mental state so damaged! I struggled a lot during the last fight. Having to play Ellie trying to drown Abby was extremely hard, I cried like a baby. I really wanted them to make peace and hug each other. That didn’t happen, but at least Ellie stopped and didn’t kill her. The ending is so freaking sad! Again, no game or media has ever made me feel like this. Simply incredible! What a masterpiece this game is!",0.6093388795852661
comments discussing characters of the game,"Exactly that! Playing as Abby was sooo much fun and it was an emotional roller coaster. The end of the game broke me too man. I could never play that part ever again. Fighting Abby in that current state... ugh. My heart ACHED.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Yikes, this thread represents exactly what I hate about the discourse surrounding this game. It’s either the best game ever, a true artistic masterpiece or the worst piece of garbage ever made.
In my opinion it’s neither. Technically the game is top notch. Obviously the graphics are fantastic. The gameplay builds on what Part 1 did well and makes it better. It’s really well acted and the moment to moment writing is pretty good.
But the game suffers from its pacing. Cutting to a ~10 hour playable flashback in the middle of what seemed to be the climax of the game is a really bold choice. I understand what they were trying to do and I appreciate that they were willing to take risks, but it just throws everything off. (And it’s something I was really hoping the show would attempt to fix.) Then we return to climax and it’s not even the end of game. I understand what they’re doing with the Santa Barbra section thematically, but it doesn’t work from a story structure standpoint.

When it came out, I really liked it. I wasn’t butt hurt by playing as (not sure how to do spoilers) the other character, but I found the simplicity of the first games story so much stronger that it kind of hurt the sequel to me. It was just too big. 
This time though… holy smokes - the gray of everything really, really hit me hard this time. By the end, not only did I like that other character, but I liked her MORE than Ellie. The scene of Ellie leaving to go to California fucking hurt - I’m a dad now, maybe that’s why - and the gameplay just felt so good this time.

comments discussing characters of the game,"There are some things i really like about it, like the enemy AI, fighting Tommy and Ellie was really cool, the savageness of it, but it did have some flaws.
Going from day 3 back to day 1 was a big turnoff. I feel if they switched characters throughout the whole game, it would've been more engaging and impactful. You also would've cared a lot more about killing Owen and the dog as Ellie. Would've been so shocking.
I also agree with the general sentiment that, Tommy and Joel introducing themselves like that was stupid and out of character. Also Ellie went idiotic on the last leg. I didn't buy her doing all that. But it's fiction, they can do whatever they want.
I get that it may not be for everyone, cause it is quite miserable. A friend of mine had to stop playing cause it was too much for her.

comments discussing characters of the game,"That's the most reasonable case. For example, most of the time, the complaint that comes up in the very beginning of the game is how joel doesn't say the appropriate things right before he dies. That statement underestimates video games a lot, especially ones crafted like this one. Neil explained in a podcast with Troy Baker, how he finds it interesting/weird that so many people make that complaint when he thinks the facial expressions, camera work, delivery of lines and overall feeling of tension make it pretty obvious that joel is aware of something. Throwing useless exposition at a moment like this just isn't something that this game will do. It was implied how joel read the room, thought somey was off and even awkwardly tried to explain how they should leave quickly. Joel didn't just walk into a place, and hang out with a bunch of strangers. There was a process that was then emphasized by the production/acting to get to his death. That's just one example, there are so many more, that I often wonder if all these people even played the first game or understand how emotional impact works in these kinds of stories.

So, I tend to do a 2nd or more playthroughs (which was the case with TLOU) to really get my thoughts right!
Every moment hits different and all the scenes take on different meanings from previous playthroughs... it was hard to replay all the hard mood parts, even thought you know what’s gonna happen, but it’s worth it!

And I absolutely love how after almost 10 months, this game is still being dived into and explained. Everyone has a different interpretation of what sections mean. ND shockingly leaves a LOT of its external narrative up to fans interpretations without feeling as if something is missing from the story. They tell the core and leave the rest up to how the fans would dive into stuff.
(Even through yeah, it would had been nice for a bigger mention of characters from the first game, I'm actually glad they didn't mention barely anything. Because it means nothing is 'confirmed' about past characters, which I adore because they still leave stuff up to the fans.)
You pretty much nailed it though, we saw Ellie's growth as a character.. through Abby. Now this seems really silly at first, but let me break it down a little.
Through Abby's eyes, we see Ellie. Not the person Ellie, but the emotions Ellie have, and where Ellie would have ended up. The amount of people who act as if killing Abby would have solved everything... It wouldn't had. Abby spent YEARS trying to find her father's killer, and she did that. And for a moment, she got her sweet release.
And then we see her Seattle Day 1, I'd personally say a few days to a weeks after Joel if you factor traveling and everything like that. And Abby isn't over it. Abby is our proof, that what Ellie was trying to do, was hurting her more than it was helping her. Abby was the reason we SHOULD reason with why Abby didn't get killed by Ellie at the end. Because the message isn't 'revenge bad, bad guys actually good' like some people would say... It's Revenge isn't a stage of grief. I don't know if you have ever lost anyone.. but when you lose someone so close to you, the first thing you do after your initial... Is to blame someone, worthy or not. Directly caused or not. It's to blame someone. And Abby was our answer that.. what Ellie was doing, isn't the ""revenge subplot"" that some people who hate the game think it is.. it's showing you that revenge isn't a stage of grief, but learning to cope is. And Abby didn't give her self time to cope or feel as if she had lost her father.. she trained and trained to find and kill the person who did it.
Ellie did the exact same. Ellie didn't give herself time to mourn Joel's death. She cried, but she never put him to rest (important point for what you mentioned.) She held on to every little bit of Joel she could. Carrying his watch and even his jacket. She literally wore Joel's jacket when she left HER family, the family Joel gave to her. (Another important point) that's when Ellie ""lost herself."" Because she lost him, the lyrics to Future Days tell the story here.. she lost him, and now she's lost herself.
People who say ""Joel would have wanted her to get revenge"" really don't understand what the story of Joel is.. do you really think, Joel, the guy who risked his own life and put a lifetime bounty ontop of his head to save one girl who could have saved humanity.. would have wanted Ellie to walk away from what Joel gifted to her? He essentially gave his life up, for Ellie to live hers.
Ellie let's go of Joel. She doesn't come back wearing his jacket, and then leaves the guitar behind.. but she's still wearing Dina's bracelet. She's ready to move on now. Ellie doesn't move on because she was ready to move on. Ellie moves on because she knows she had too. It's in that moment, when she remembers Joel saying ""if I was given a second chance, I'd do it all over again."" Is Ellie finally, FINALLY letting go of the image of Joel being broken on the floor which she had nightmares about for months and months.
I have said multiple times on this sub, I don't think Ellie would have made it home from Santa Barbara if she killed Abby that night. For one reason. She would have lost her innocence with nobody to fall onto. David? Joel held her. Nora? Dina held her. Abby...? She had already lost everyone who could hold her due to revenge, she's lost them because she thought that's how she reaches the next stage of grief. This is how she moves on from everything.. but it wasn't. And that SPLIT second where she had Abby from life or death and she let go? Was her realising that moment.. the moment that Ellie realized, it was down to HER to leave Joel and bury his memories.. Killing Abby would have taken away temporary pain. But much like what we saw with Abby... That freedom is only temporary and you need to find your own way to move past this stage.
So when Ellie came back, and could FINALLY draw Joel's eyes again? It's a huge sign to show that she's moved on and in the next stage of grief. She doesn't close her eyes and think of Joel being the broken mess on the floor with his skull crushed, She closes her eyes and remembers the real Joel..the type of Joel who would sit on the porch playing guitar. But, like you said. Music was how Joel drowned out the bad stuff. Joel had a thing.. which I feel as if it rubbed off on Ellie. Don't talk about the bad stuff. He used music to express himself ~ but Ellie didn't use music to express herself. Ellie used music to remember Joel, because like you said, music was Joel's thing.
She realises that Joel will always be with her, that she doesn't need to play /his/ song every single moment she had a chance too...it was time to make her own song, in a way. Would she leave music forever? I don't think so. But she needed to leave the biggest part of Joel that was stopping her move on.
I absolutely love this games ending. Even from Abby's section to Ellie's post santa Barbara section.. it's one of those that just stick with you. I played this game the week it came out and not again since, and I'm STILL filled with ideas that I'm still trying to get down into text to just speak about. I feel like people saw the leaks and had a bad feeling about it. And the Abby stuff was unexpected.. but serves purpose when you really think about it.",0.6140670776367188
comments discussing characters of the game,"I think about this game all the damn time. After I finished it its opened my eyes to how stagnant storytelling in gaming has kind of become.

Fight insert completely evil villian that leaves little room for interpretation as they are always just “evil”.

Also ign gave one of my favourite childhood games a 4.9/10. Which is funny because the user score today is 9.1/10. But I can't blame a single person for rating a game that low because maybe they just didn't find the gameplay appealing at all?
Game enjoyment is subjective. Just because I love Elden Ring, doesn't mean the average person will. At the end of the day a rating doesn't tell us much.

Ellie absolutely would have killed Abby earlier if she could have, there's a part earlier in the game where she tries very hard to and only narrowly fails. But by the end of the game letting Abby go felt like the choice Ellie would have made. A big part of what made that believable to me was actually how she reacted to killing some of the other people involved in Joel's death - without too many spoilers it gradually gives more insight into why Ellie became so obsessed with hunting everyone down and how it isn't going to help her.",0.6148080825805664

comments discussing characters of the game,"The one thing about the game I can’t criticise is the gameplay. I think it’s brilliant and as good as it gets in the genre.
I do agree that the story is too bleak. There’s nothing wrong with telling a dark story (I prefer it) but you’re never given anything you can hold onto. Sam and Henry’s deaths are meaningless if we hadn’t grown to know and care about them. The incredibly bitter ending is made more impactful by the giraffe scene being the last time we see Joel and Ellie legitimately happy together.
I don’t think Lev being trans was heavy handed I think it was handled well enough.
My biggest criticism with the game stems from most of the characters just being incredibly boring. Abby and Owen are both bland and don’t really have anything interesting going on with them aside from Abby’s relationship with Lev. Which is just imitating a far better dynamic anyway. I think I could’ve been invested in Abby’s story if she was a better character.
Yeah Joel’s death sucks and makes no sense. We’re meant to believe that he’s gotten soft but the only evidence for that is when he’s killed. It honestly comes off like the development team were resentful of how acclaimed the first game was and wanted to tear it all down. But it was acclaimed because it was a well written story and what we got with Part 2 really wasn’t.
Even retconning the Ellie=cure situation to having been a 100% certainty when we’re never shown that in the first game is a sign of bad writing to me.",0.6411873698234558

Like yeah, at surface level, that's what happens but clearly the people she kills, she does so with a misguided tunnel vision and perspective, while in the epilogue she's clearly doing so from a way the player is meant to disagree with, contrary to the first half of the game.
Also I feel had the character died later in the game, it would've changed what the game was about but to each their own.
I really like the game and always have but my main gripe is the side characters. I think Lev and Tommy are fantastic and I liked Yara but most of the other characters felt like they were variations of the Naughty Dog sarcastically funny archetype. For example Dina. She's cool but she's way too similar to Ellie, so she doesn't offer interesting perspectives or ways to challenge what Ellie is doing because she behaves and speaks like another different Ellie.

comments discussing characters of the game,Honestly I think overall this is a perfectly valid and fair take on the game. I enjoyed it immensely when I played it and thought the Abby twist was interesting. That said I’ve only played it once because I find it so deeply depressing - there’s nothing in it for me to find worth replaying because the whole scenario is so fucked up. Meanwhile the first I’ve replayed like 8 times. It just breathes a little better. I still enjoyed Ellie’s character arc in it and even in the end despite all of it neither one of them Abby or Ellie feels redeemed it just feels like they both got to live. Obviously the game preaches peace and not killing and then you’re just mowing down or stabbing people left and right but I think ultimately that’s just…it’s a video game.

With all of that answered, i give absolutely 0 fucks as to who reads what i say or if anyone reads at all. I felt the need to express my opinions, which i did, it just so happens that there have been plenty of comments from people willing to discuss with me.
Also, i am still waiting for the original commenter to show me EXACTLY what he/she thinks was written by AI and i will need proof or a legitimate reason as to why he/she thinks that.
Even if it was written by AI, which it wasn’t, who gives a fuck? Also, out of everything i said, the only thing he/she has to say at the end of it all was that it was written by AI? Thats a clicker brain if i ever saw one.",0.661263644695282

""Kay has an extremely robotic and superficial personality, which causes moments in the game that should be narratively impactful to do the opposite, leaving players with a bitter taste and unfulfilled expectations. On top of that, there’s a consistent trend where all the action-oriented characters and those making decisions are typically the tokenized profiles that Star Wars has been throwing in our faces ever since the Disney acquisition…""

comments discussing characters of the game,"The reputation system feel like a gimmick at best. I haven't seen it really affected the story in a very meaningful way.
That being said, from what i've seen sinking about 30 hours and already done with the main story. this is easily one of the upper tier Star Wars storyline. Yes, entire Star Wars chronology, not just games. It was just plain old 'Satuday morning' cartoon fun just like Mandalorian. These people truly understand why Star Wars is fun and going all-in for it. Star Wars video games really tend to never miss and certainly not this one by a long shot. A slow start i will admit, but when more character start to shown up it gets very engaging fast.
The environment is also fantastic. Coming from the same people that made Avatar j shouldn't be surprise. I think this is easily one of the most 'alive' world in sometime for a Ubisoft game. I love how 'busy' everywhere is. Inside the town you'll find stormtropper 'inspect' people, people discussing about their day-to-day life or their luck and misfortune around these so-called 'lawless' world.
Going outside you'll see faction fighting each other, Stormtrooper patrol and TIE fighter flying around (and you can get wanted stars by them and they'll send the fucking death trooper at you. And you should fear them.) They sure embrace the George Lucas 'every scene feel busy' to the tee here.
One of my favorite moment is in early game, i had to sneak in Imperial base. That whole area around it is full of checkpoint and speeder bike stormtrooper patrol, they will alert you on site. I couldn't shoot my way in so i had to spend over 5 minutes sneaking around bushes. I completed the objective and got spotted. Instant 4 stars and i had to shoot and run my way out of there because they would just keep coming. That is absolutely fucking thrilling, it fulfill my lifelong dream as a star wars fans to be a little scoundrel running away from Stormtrooper. I don't think any game offer this feeling before and it is certainly quiet unique experience. In early game they are absolutely a threat and i love it.
I don't think this game will do much for non-fan of Star Wars and if you're here because the whole faction thing sound cool on paper, i'd say wait for the discount. But if you love Star Wars? I would say this title easily worth 70$. I would happily buy this full price for how entertaining and engaging this game is.

I would point to the Battlestar Galactica reboot with the character of Starbuck (among many other done with in the series) being an good example this being successfully pulled off (arguably the second Starbuck is even more nuanced than the original take). However, in so many productions now days often it gets done in a lazy manner more for a gimmick create a false buzz (I say false because the producers confuse any talk, pro or con, as actual interest in watching their show) or just as a cheap (un)""original"" take on the source. That laziness of ideas tend to be reflected in rest of their script writing going foreword. As you point out in The Watch, they fall back on hackneyed tropes rather than understand what made the character work for audience in the first place.
Unfortunately, criticisms of any sort even one as well written as this one tend to be dismissed out of hand by the offending agencies as reflective of some sort of an ""-ism"" rather than a reasoned critique and not used in understanding why it failed to achieve levels of success desired for reference in future endeavors of this sort.",0.6010655760765076

comments discussing characters of the game,"I disagree, I think that the OPs point is that it begs a discussion that the story will inherently be better in it’s original format. This show really convinced me that no video game can ever truly be successfully translated to a TV/Film medium. I was a big believer in TLOU as a TV show, I thought it would be the perfect game to make into a TV show. And in a lot of ways thats true; it probably can’t get much better than this.
The narrative is inextricably bound to the dynamic between passive storytelling and active storytelling through QTEs and gameplay. So much of the narrative only works as well as it does as a result of the personal connection a well executed video game narrative will foster. Without it, well, the story hits less hard. There’s not enough time to tell the story well and efficiently, and there seems to be no good way to translate the character traits and thematic elements that are shown through gameplay. Ellie torturing Nora will literally never be as powerful as it is in the game, because in the game you love Ellie, you are Ellie, and the game removes your power/control and forces you to watch Ellie’s face and actively make her torture Nora to death.
It doesn’t matter how well they do it, the scene’s effectiveness is completely resultant from the storytelling elements that only exist in video games.
So if a show can never do the story as well, what’s the point? Is it even possible to translate a video game narrative to film and have it be just as good? After watching this show (which I enjoyed and would give a solid 7.5/10) I do not think it can be done. I would absolutely love to be proven wrong tho.

comments discussing characters of the game,"<sarcasm> I'm glad that was a honest reaction. There's been so many dishonest ones with people lying about what their opinions are. </sarcasm>
The complaints in the 1:1 comparisons are precisely why so many changes were made. It's not about which delivery was better. You're already familiar with the game's scenes. It's what you know and expect, so in any scenes that copy the game, you're going to see any deviations as something wrong.
All of us who have played the game are looking at it with that bias. It will be interesting to see people who first saw the story in the show play the game and see if they feel the game or the show was superior in those scenes. I'd bet they prefer the show's versions since it will be what they already know.
My own opinion is that gameplay will tend to involve people more. You're not watching Joel and Ellie. You ARE Joel (or Ellie) and you're experiencing their journey first hand and not just a spectator. That will change your perspective.

I loved the games, but clearly it didn't hit me nearly as hard as it hit a lot of people in this sub. I don't find myself having such strong reactions to one line here or there as I see in this sub, and I think that's OK—it's cool to see people waiting to see certain things that I'd completely forgotten happened—but I also think that those things stick with you because they hit you a certain way at a certain time in your life and you can never replicate that, and while it's great that art does that for people, it's not really a great way to compare things because it's so distinct for every person.
I loved the show, too. I do think there were things they could've done better, and I think simply by nature of immersing yourself in a game for many, many times longer, you're obviously likely to get some more feeling of growth and attachment than the show would ever have been able to portray. I think they did a really good job, but nothing's perfect and there's always room for improvement that's worth discussing.
I think a lot of people liked the games as action games, and so a lack of infected in the show was disappointing to them like it wasn't to me (as I age, I actually want less action in my media—it tends to be the least-interesting thing on screen, for me), but I also think the criticism that the infected were too sparse is fair—they are, after all, the reason Ellie needed protection, and the whole reason for the journey at all.
I think that's my biggest agreement with the criticism I've heard. The other stuff really just feels to me like someone who placed the games in a very special place in their heart, and nothing will ever take that away, and that's great, but it's not a particularly level-headed analysis of the adaptation.",0.6484222412109375

comments discussing characters of the game,"I agree with a lot of what was said here. I think this series is much better for people who have not played the game. I originally thought the gameplay aspects of the game weren't important to the story. They may not be important to the plot and so those that watched the show without experiencing the game first are going to have a much better reaction to it, but to me the gameplay aspects play a huge role in the development of the relationships between the characters. You fight to protect Ellie and in doing so your brain creates this bond to her that isn't matched in the show. It's even the same with Tess. In the game her death was much more of an emotional beat because you spend time fighting with her and while we got a truncated version of that in the show it wasn't enough to really cement that bond the game created.
And I'm not sure why, but the end of the finale felt off to me even though it was pretty identical to the game. In the show I really felt like Ellie was just a replacement for Sarah to Joel while in the game it felt like their bond was their own thing. The way Joel said something about Sarah and then said ""that's not to say"" (you don't have a great smile for example) felt almost cruel in the show.

They told the story perfectly for the video game medium in the game and told it pretty much perfectly for television imo. They were never going to be the same and they shouldn’t.

When a gamer plays a game, the gameplay is the point and story is fluff.
On TV it’s flipped. I would have enjoyed seeing more infected fights, but that’s gameplay. It’s fluff on TV. It’s why most people don’t like watching others play a game. We’d rather be playing ourselves instead of watching.
Meanwhile, in the game, there’s so much gameplay that there’s tons of places to insert fluff(story) to build characters over a lengthy (much longer than a show) period of time.
So of course the game hits harder. And the show could / should have had a few more episodes. To their credit, though, the show cut nearly all the fluff(gameplay).",0.6499537825584412

comments discussing characters of the game,"I played the game for the first time just before starting to watch the show. In my opinion, I thought certain scenes hit harder in the show than the game.

Maybe it’s just that the gameplay is starting to show its age, but it felt clunky and unresponsive, and it was difficult for me to look past it. So watching the show without that added frustration let me just enjoy the story and the character development.
All that said, I do agree that there probably should have been more time dedicated to fleshing out their relationship in the show (and honestly more infected.)

There was also a general lack of underlying tension from the infected as soon as they left Kansas City. The importance of Ellie's immunity dwindled slightly with this, which also reduced the significance of Joel's (and Marlene's) choices in the end.

people always bring up “but its not supposed to copy the game!” then why did it do almost everything else the same?

comments discussing characters of the game,"but because the series was an expended retelling with significant portions dedicated to secondary characters, an additional episode or two—solely dedicated to spending more time with Joel and Ellie—would have allowed their pivotal moments to leave a larger emotional impact.
I agree with a lot do what you said. the immersive of gaming really allows you to consume the story telling in a very intimate way that is very difficult for a show/movie medium to match. but in defense for the game, the 20 or so hours that the player spends with Ellie and Joel, it’s going to make the 9 hour show feel very compressed. I would think the other way around, imo, the show did an amazing job to encapsulate this much emotion, character development, and themes in only 9 episodes!
for the side characters, i truly love what the show did because i disagree on your statement above. the side characters add so much to the story of Joel and Ellie’s development than most people come to grasp. Bill and Frank’s scene on “i was never afraid until you show up”, introduced the theme of fear and really drives the development of Joel and Ellie’s relationship. you see in episode 6 when Joel goes into anxiety attack. you see Joel breaking down due to fear of experience of losing a child again when he was confessing to Tommy. Episode 8, when David says “there is no fear in love”, what a contrast to the theme. i was deeply moved by the writing.
Then the side character from episode 7, the Left behind DLC, which portrays Ellie’s motivation to never give up. in retrospect to she did not want to give up on Tess in episode 2. but more importantly, to how Ellie never gave up on Joel. in turn, this drives Joel’s finale decision as he has been touched by Ellie’s light.
my point is: the show could try to replace the side character episodes with just Joel and Ellie. but from a cinema story telling perspective, my god the show’s usage of Bill and Frank, and Riley, was a masterclass in character development of Ellie and Joel. the show is compressed but is so tastefully done.
Bonus: would love to know your thoughts in episode 6 on the usage of “look for the light” theme. After Joel’s convo with Tommy, he was clearly lost. Tommy even had to tell Joel directions to their house driving on the theme that he’s lost both emotionally and physically. then he reaches the house and looked up for a moment and see’s the light on the 2nd floor where Ellie is. i thought this was one of the most beautiful shot. then after that iconic scene that we all know from the game, that additional scene of Joel in his room i front of the lamp, thinking about Sarah. soon after the music abruptly ends while he turns off the lamp. at this point i believe Joel is starting to accept Ellie and overcome his fear and made the decision to give Ellie a chance. incredible directing, acting, and story telling.",0.6050014495849609

I couldn't bring myself to enjoy the series, from the beggining it showed that the acting and dialogue wasn't on par with the game, not that the acting was bad by any means, but the game's acting is superb. I even did the exercise of watching Sarah's death on both media, and the game still makes me cry a little, while is series is... not quite that emotional. To me, Pedro fails at the subtle acting that Joel as a character required (which explains why they had to show him taking those pills and alcohol to show the viewer that he is a broken man, we didn't need that in the game to understand that). However, I enjoyed some of the lore that was added to the show, Joel's radio system of knowing when he's got new info, the boy that arrived to the city and FEDRA coldly killed that Joel saw later, the interconnected infected, all that was very nice. But, what kicked me out of the series were 2 things basically, how ""hollywood"" it was (the plane that crashed at the beggining whose wheel crashed Joel and Tommy's car? come on, if ""realism"" is what made them eliminate the spores, isn't it way more realist to crash another car? specially when society is falling down), and the dialogue. In particular early on with Tess, she was an exposition character that wasn't needed to be (show, don't tell), and they completely changed her character. Well, I'm aware that we're probably in a ""golden age"" of good video game adaptation, but I didn't enjoy this one, even if it's best, because I find that it lacks at the main point of the story, making us care about Joel and Ellie.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I think the series was decent and if I hadn't played the game or was invested in these characters beforehand (therefore knowing in my mind exactly how I wanted the emotional or impactful moments to play out in advance) I would have thought it was better.
I understand they were restricted on time so had to speed up Joel and Ellie's bonding, but for me the switch happened too suddenly.
Also as you say, some of the moments that were echoed from the game such as the conversation in the house when Ellie is reading the diary and the whole ""you're right you're not my daughter"" etc moment, and when Joel changes his mind to take Ellie instead of Tommy doing it, just felt too quickly delivered for me without the tension and really feeling the weight of their words. The pacing of those dialogue scenes and the way they said it felt flat to me and left me saying ""noooo!!!"" At the screen as it felt like a real missed opportunity, esprcially because in those moments at least they had allocated time to deliver the game dialogue.
I'm going to give the series a second watch now that I know the changes and overall pacing differences, and perhaps this will help me view it more purely from a TV series point of view rather than directly comparing it to the game which has probably been my mistake so far.
I'm in no way saying the series as bad, and as I say above I think if I hadn't played the game and gone into it with certain expectations then I think I would rate it more highly. Everyone I know who doesn't play games has loved it, and I am still glad they have added more material to this great franchise and its largely been a success.",0.6401211619377136
comments discussing characters of the game,"There are a lot of reviews that have more to say than “this did or didn’t happen in the game,” like this one
But to your greater point, I think the comparisons as to which version was more “hard hitting” sort of misses an essential point.
The net subjective ‘impact’ of a story isn’t the only currency to judge it by. The show is interested in burrowing into thematic spaces that we couldn’t explore in the game (Joel’s paternal FEAR, not just reluctance, the deliberations and interiority of NPCs, the role imagination plays in courage, etc.) it’s a different “dimension” of the last of us, and should be thought about and enjoyed on its own merits, even while we relish in the echoes of the game we love some much. Just feel like this analysis suffers from something I’ve been seeing over and and over again: personal subjectivity.
For instance, I COULDN’T agree less about the performances. Bella especially is outrageously good. Of course, she benefits from having an actual human face.",0.6182292699813843

comments discussing characters of the game,"Great, well written post. I think my biggest critique of the show is that the show should’ve done more to differentiate itself from the game. The best things for me in the show, that being outbreak day / following Sarah and Episode 3 are the best because the show tried to do something different and ended up being better than the game counterparts. For Kathleen as a character I wish we saw more of her brutality but I do like her role in the show as it gave depth to the hunters, so I do praise the writer/show runners for adding her. Making Joel and Ellie’s personalities more alike as discussed on TLOU HBO podcast whereas how diff they are in the first game was a neat change, as well as exploring Joel’s humanity. Tho I agree that while it’s nice to see the 1-1 dialogue in some scenes, I think next season just don’t do that and make the show it’s own rather than emulate the game. Then again the show is trying to be a faithful adaptation rather than say, the Uncharted movie which deviated from the source material to explore a new adventure.

comments discussing characters of the game,"In both of your posts, you've written out much better than I could exactly why the show was inferior to the game. On TV, the weight of the decisions weren't felt nearly as much because they weren't my decisions.
The show was disappointing, but I realize in retrospect it was probably impossible for it not to be. The game packed such an emotional punch -- one that is rarely achieved by any artistic endeavor, let alone a video game
Two scenes in particular -- you're not my daughter, and the sexual assault -- didn't resonate the way I had hoped. I think in part because the aspect of embodying these characters in the game brought me closer to them emotionally. I WAS Joel, and I WAS Ellie when these scenes occurred. With the show, I was watching them, not being them. This took away greatly from the effectiveness. I never felt the visceral connection to the characters that I did in the video game.
Also, possibly an unpopular take, but Bella sucked as Ellie. She was hard to like, whereas I loved video game Ellie.
There are other criticisms I have which I won't bore you with here, but that's the main thrust of why the show missed the mark, IMHO.",0.6059439182281494

comments discussing characters of the game,"This is what I think of much of this analysis.
Game Ellie (GE for short) isn't at all believable to me as a teenaged girl. I'm not knocking Ashley Johnson's acting ability, but she was 28/29 when the game was released.
GE and Game Joel (GJ) having an argument is a different song that hits different notes for me. GJ is rougher, angrier, more raw. He's angry with himself, maybe because he feels old and slow, maybe because he knows that he's beginning to have fatherly feelings towards GE. Maybe it's a generational thing, but between the uncanny valley sensation and the overacting, this scene sounds like nails on a chalkboard to me. GJ comes across as alternately wooden and over-the-top. I just can't with GE.
Show Joel (SJ) has more depth to me. He knows that he's a bit too old and a step too slow to keep Show Ellie (SE) safe. Bella's performance here is subtle and sublime; she can't quite let the walls down completely, but you can tell how much SJ's decision pains her. Pedro plays this one much closer to the vest, but his anger is palpable. I've watched the ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes at the end of several of the episodes, but I haven't listened to the podcast. Overall, I get the impression that they purposefully underplayed the character to make SJ's explosion at the end of the season all the more shocking.
A huge caveat is that I haven't played the game, and probably never will. Long-form dramatic games are usually not my cup of tea, although I respect them as an art-form. I don't have the patience to try to run through a scene 15 times to make it across. I will say that I've watched a buttload of scenes from the game on YouTube, and I have deep suspicions about the critical chops of anyone who would make a bullshit claim such as the game's scenes being better than the show 9 times out of 10.
The show has some obvious pacing problems, and having 2 out of 9 episodes be largely flashback-based contributed to that. They probably needed (at least) 1 more episode to more fully flesh out the story, more aptly demonstrate the continuing danger of the infected, and give the showrunner some breathing room with which to let the tale unfurl. It's a damn shame the show wasn't made 3 years ago, when money was flowing and auteurs could almost write blank checks for heady conceptual pieces like this. Unfortunately, that's not a world we inhabit anymore, and the new overlords of HBO seem determined to transform it from a prestige television destination to something between Dollywood and Branson. Showrunners will have to do less with more, and try to squeeze in a maximum amount of storytelling into fewer episodes per season and fewer minutes per episode.",0.6040780544281006

comments discussing characters of the game,"Not to refute you from a presumptuous position of objectivity, because I think there's some validity to ""ludonarrative dissonance"" critiques in this game. But a few explanations that soften the dissonance, at least for me:
Ellie has a breakdown after killing some people that we have names for now, freaking out about their deaths. However, the gameplay up until that point has Ellie functioning like the angel of death killing damn near everyone/thing she has to engage with.
(Spoilers ahead)
The WLF were killing all trespassers. That added an element of self-defense (while often brutal and maybe on the preemptive side) to Ellie's encounters with patrols.
The torture scene is implied to be far more brutal than anything Ellie had done until that point. And Ellie had never tortured anyone before then.
Ellie has been killing people since childhood in TLOU1, when scavenging for medical supplies to help Joel. She's clearly no stranger to murderin', just like pretty much every other character in this series.
Killing Mel obviously carried the additional weight of killing a child. Ellie had justified everyone's death either by association to Abby or the WLF. But a kid is clearly a gut-check moment for her (sorry, had to).
I think when you add all these considerations up, the whole ludonarrative dissonance thing becomes less of a barrier to experiencing the story. It's definitely a factor regardless, but I think it's explained away well enough to account for the gameplay and not make it story-breaking. At least, for me.",0.6266652941703796
comments discussing characters of the game,"yeah, finally. Nora was like her first kill in the season, which is wild. In the game, the energy you saw during the Nora scene is palpable and it's visibly fighting to break out of Ellie the entire time. She grunts at things Dina asks her like ""what do those rainbows mean?"" and calls Dina a burden for being pregnant. At another time, she comments on her intelligence from all the problem solving she does. Dina leaves Ellie for not giving up her path of vengeance, but in the show Dina reinforces that they should never stop chasing (twice). These things are written completely the opposite direction in the show, and its jarring. The entire time in the game Ellie is blatantly prioritizing vengeance over anything and everything else in her life, which is just not the direction the show has decided to take. The show is not bad, and I like Bella and trust they'll make it make sense, but to say Ellie is remotely similar to the game version of her is just silly, the two are different characters completely, and I think it's intentional.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Show-Ellie’s version of experiencing trauma is just as realistic.
I’m not sure I’ve seen criticism of Ellie’s show characterization of trauma as being unrealistic, but I’m sure there has been.
For me it’s not about which one is more realistic, it’s about which one is moving Ellie’s character more effectively to where she needs to get to in the context of the final story. The show, IMO, hasn’t given us enough of Ellie’s anger for her turn villain.
To say it another way, in the show the first time we really get that was in the Nora scene, which we still haven’t seen the aftermath from, but in the game it’s played as equal to Joel’s torture. A point of no return for Ellie.

comments discussing characters of the game,"This is a really well written post. And to branch off of it a little bit. I’d add the following.
I think the deviation from the game is subject to criticism. But a lot of people are just bluntly arguing “it didn’t play out like this in the game, so it’s bad now”. And I don’t buy that. That’s not legitimate criticism, in my view.
They’re still following the plot and story of the game pretty damn accurately overall. Sure, characters motives and emotional state have shifted or been altered, but that was bound to happen as they added scenes to fit a show format.
When I compare this adaptation to something like the early seasons of The Walking Dead, you can’t even make the case that they’re not following the source material for Part 2. In The Walking dead, season 1 was a completely unique storyline after the first episode. Season 2 was drawn out and adapted completely differently than the comics. The only similarity was where the season took place. And it was still damn good. Season 3 expanded on the comics in a unique way. The golden era of TWD were the seasons that deviated from the source material the most. It wasn’t until season 7ish that they really started following the comics closely, and the show fell off pretty drastically from that point on.
I say this just to highlight that all things considered, the show has adapted part 2 pretty accurately compared to most other adaptations. They haven’t skipped any major scenes or plot points. In fact, most of the biggest moments are followed damn near shot for shot.
If these changes aren’t for you, that’s totally fine. But how people argue their opinions on the show matters. If you’re bluntly “this show is bad. They broke the characters. They’re not following the source material” I think you should just play the game and not bother watching. Because if you wanted a mirror copy, that was never going to happen. And if you can’t judge the show based on the quality of each episode and how the episodes flow, that’s a you problem.
To circle back to your post, I’m with you that a few episodes this season ended and I was like “it didn’t feel like much happened”. But I also noticed while watching that these episodes are probably going to be much better binged because they flow really well from episode to episode. I’m always left wanting more. The biggest issue is I can’t just start the next episode. This season feels way more like an episodic series. The first season felt like each episode was its own story, since it was largely dedicated to traveling across the country. Each episode could be watched as its own story. This season, each episode is just part of a larger arc that culminates in major events.
This season feels a lot like the farm arc in season 2 or TWD. A lot of episodes feel like not much happens. But when you have the entire season, it’s something you’ll probably binge in a day or two. Because they lead into each other really well. And even though season 2 of TWD is perhaps the least consistent with the comics, it’s by far my favorite season. I have a feeling I’m going to feel the same way about season 2 of TLOU as well, after it’s all over.",0.6185588836669922

comments discussing characters of the game,"Literally couldn't agree more. The criticism that the main theme of this game was ""revenge bad"" betrays a fundamental and likely bad faith lack of engaging with text and subtext. I agree that the story is more about these two women trying to navigate their grief and find purpose and agency in a hostile world.
For Ellie, I realized it was never about revenge but her trying to take control when control was consistently ripped away from her. Her decision to die with Riley backfired. Joel robbed her of her decision to help with a cure, even if it meant her life. And Abby robbed her of her decision to try to reconcile with Joel. As you said, finding and killing the people that killed Joel gave her a purpose. It was her reason to ""keep fighting"" which is what Joel told her at the end of the first game. All of this comes back around to the end where Ellie, herself, makes the decision to spare Abby. She had to make that decision herself and I'm glad the game came full circle and allowed her to do so.

comments discussing characters of the game,"But I feel that works again as another point of the game. Abby for Ellie and Joel was essentially one of those random people, only she had the means of tracking them down and seeking the revenge. I think with the game's addition of giving names to the random people was meant to further display that these are people that others know, care for, etc, and that Ellie's blind rage through Seattle could easily result in the exact same thing that happened to Joel could happen to her in the future.
I think this could further be backed up by how Joel reacts to hearing Abby ask him if he remembers her, and he replies by saying ""Get whatever speech you have planned out of the way.""

Some of these characters were killed for far less than Abby and I can only imagine what kind of rage would enter someone's mind when their fingers get bitten off. Especially someone who has had to fight for their life and through injuries as much as Ellie has.
Regardless, I am not sure what else is added to the story by making Ellie cease her quest for vengeance at that exact moment (other than to inflate the drama). The idea of Ellie's exhaustion and feelings of futility had been communicated. If the writers were that confident Ellie would fight, I think they needed to commit to what happens next.

To sort of just push back on some of the points made, however, is that it's just showing you the perspective of the fireflies that we haven't seen from the first one. In the original they're portrayed as terrorist, but their cause was rebelling against the militaristic oppression within the safe zones which reflects that morally grayness(it's all about perspective). The sequel may not go that far in portraying that side of them, but we see Marline conflicted by the decision to go forward with the procedure (also, with neither them not waking ellie and asking {which makes sense because they didn't want the sole person they know to be immune to the virus to walk out, even if she were to have agreed} it shows that Ellie just truly didn't have a choice at all and that from both angles her right to choose was going to be stripped away)
I also want to say I don't think the game was Explicitly trying to make Joel out as the bad guy, but to just show the lasting impact of his decision because for a lot of players saw his actions as grey, but as justified. Hell some people don't even do that much, and just accept what he did was right, full stop. The game doesn't demonize him for doing so, even going as far to show he would've still done it all over again because of his bond with Ellie

If you were adapting the game as is you'd need Abby at 2 (technically 3) different ages, one normal and one buff AF. Your options are: cast two different people, cast a buff woman as Abby, or cast a non-buff woman as Abby. CGI muscles or body doubles are another option but have a lot of obvious downsides. Making a young actress GET ripped for such a role would take literally years of training.
Ultimately they went with the best actor for the character and yeah the body type doesn't match but I think they've made the best possible decision here. Being jacked is absolutely an important part of her character but it's just one of those compromises you have to make, so of course they will be out their defending their creative choices.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Completely agree. Every bit of violence in TLOU 1 felt justified; every raider or infected killed in the game was going to kill Joel or Ellie and there was no other choice. You were fighting just to survive.
While the doctors death in Part 1 was rightfully controversial if he was alive the Fireflies would have kept searching for Ellie to kill her so while morally you might not like it there was at least some justification for it in the mind of Joel that you can relate to even if you don't personally agree with. It wasn't a happy ending, no story in this world really could be.
But every single death in TLOU 2 was unnecessary. It is tragic that Abby's father died but all of the people Ellie and Abby kill were unnecessary. I know that was the point but it felt so heavy handed that it robbed the story of all of the nuance and intrigue that the first game had.
And I am annoyed as fuck that legitimate complaints like this about Abby get buried and shoved aside under a literal sea of hate comments about things that don't even matter, like how buff she was.
And this is the big thing. I don't think the story justifies it's existence but if I say I didn't enjoy it I'm an anti-trans bigot.

Yeah every game/show has that evil person they hate and it's normal, but the only difference here is that you have to play her.

I get Zwei, because he's an adorable pupper, I get Shopkeep since he appeared multiple times, but why this guy? I would've forgotten about him completely by now without this sub constantly reminding me of his existence.

Oh well, like I said, I can live with this, it's just not what I would've liked to see, personally.
Oh, and more on memery: What I don't get is why two things never catched on and got bigger: Blake standing infront of the villa she just set ablaze and saying ""humans didn't do this!"" as well as Ruby shoving away Jaune's hands while telling him to not stop doing what he's doing.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Thank you for reading and taking the time to respond.
I think you can understand Abby from the very first cutscene we see that Joel killed her father. From that cutscene I understood her, I understood why Manny spit on Joel, I understood why everything happened how it did. Of course I didn’t agree with it, but I understand it. Was 10 hours needed for that? I don’t think we needed 10 hours just to understand her.
I disagree. I understand that initial cutscene was enough for you to empathise with her, but I don't think it was enough for the vast majority of players, including myself. I still hated her—and I wasn't sure why. I needed to get inside her headspace. I need something more. Maybe that's just me being accustomed to long-form storytelling, but the possibilities of her character arc seemed super juicy and I was thirsty at the teat.
I think Abby's length was intentional to extend the game length. After playing so long, I still didn't like Abby but I just wanted to the game to end because of how exhausted I (and Ellie) was.
I thoroughly enjoyed Abby's story. Did I like her chapters as much as Ellie's on first play-through? Maybe not. But I don't think we're meant to. In the time that has passed since, I honestly think Abby's arc holds up to Ellie's—in fact, I think there's enough in her story to suggest it's even better than Ellie's.

Just my 2 cents.",0.6042855978012085
comments discussing characters of the game,"I disagree. I understand that initial cutscene was enough for you to empathise with her, but I don't think it was enough for the vast majority of players, including myself. I still hated her—and I wasn't sure why. I needed to get inside her headspace. I need something more. Maybe that's just me being accustomed to long-form storytelling, but the possibilities of her character arc seemed super juicy and I was thirsty at the teat.
I guess it makes sense that perhaps players needed a longer time to empathize with Abby after seeing her struggles.
Although by walking in Abby’s shoes, something I’ve noticed is that often times people condemn Ellie for wanting to fight Abby, or want her to spare Abby because they connected with Abby. While of course you don’t want them to fight if you like Abby, I think that’s unfair because Ellie does not have this omniscience that the player has. Abby is still the person who irreparably ruined her life to a point where she was unable to live normally, yet she still had the strength to let her go.
I feel like what players take with “no good or bad” is who you thought was good is bad (Ellie), and who you thought was bad is good (Abby)… which ironically is seeing things good or bad, just flipped.
I thoroughly enjoyed Abby's story. Did I like her chapters as much as Ellie's on first play-through? Maybe not. But I don't think we're meant to. In the time that has passed since, I honestly think Abby's arc holds up to Ellie's—in fact, I think there's enough in her story to suggest it's even better than Ellie's. I go back and forth, but Abby's third day in Seattle is my favourite section of the game. It's fucking incredible imo.
The story being good doesn’t cross out the other - like I wrote it was a very nuanced character, but the sheer length of it I believe had a purpose.
What I meant with being tired and wanting it to be over was in Santa Barbara. The game was over 20 hours of misery by that point. We want it to be over, like Ellie was tired and wanting it to be over.
About Abby’s half itself though, I think she had all of the better sections. Ellie’s half was bland in comparison, which is disappointing. They let our connection with Ellie do the heavy lifting, while giving the large majority of set pieces and moments to Abby.",0.6380406022071838

comments discussing characters of the game,"This was a very thoughtful post. 
There are two elements that seem to predict how people respond to the game. 
You've identified the first in your post: discomfort. The story is ugly, difficult, emotionally complex and asks the player to sit in feelings that are generally accepted to be 'bad'. It causes us to feel uncomfortable about how easily we can be swept into poor judgement and when faced with discomfort, we can either look within to the cause, or blame outward. For many, media is entertainment meant for comfort, so they feel betrayed by the developers. Part II is art.
The response by u/bakuhatsuda identifies the other: attention. This story demands your focus and to be immersed so that you resist the ego-protecting instinct to 'switch off' and blame the game for making you uncomfortable. The pacing of dialogue and the lingering camera and the haunting score are all in service of lengthening the time we have to weigh our own emotions against what we're experiencing. Without attention, it's impossible to connect and it's particularly bad for people streaming the game who are conditioned to react and interact, rather than to contemplate and respond.
So can you have empathy without being able to 'suffer' discomfort or being able to pay attention to the emotions of others? 
It's interesting that you feel that Korean gaming culture really latched onto hating this game. Forgive me, but as an urban Canadian, my impression is that in a lot of ways Korea can be as extremely hyper capitalist as America. The cutting edge of materialistic/consumerist culture worships comfort and demonizes 'trying too hard' or giving a lot of care an attention to things unrelated to money or 'success'. Given that baseline for a culture, is it surprising that online-forward communities are so reactively hateful toward this game?
I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm glad to hear from another person very far from me that they felt the intense humanity of this experience. You've written about vulnerability and empathy with thoughtfulness and kindness. I hope more people read your post. Thank you",0.6387475728988647
comments discussing characters of the game,"Thank you very much for your comment, brobrobrob. As you pointed out, in Korea this isn’t just an impression anymore — it’s the reality.
Interestingly, however, when it comes to film, the Korean audience tends to evaluate artistic quality more fairly.
So when I first played this game, I thought opinions might be divided, but that its artistic value would at least be recognized by many gamers.
But within the Korean gaming community, the overall response to this game is overwhelmingly negative.
That includes people who have actually played the game and even those who haven’t.
And as you mentioned, this reflects a broader cultural attitude toward media.
Content that tries to deliver deep emotional or moral messages, in other words, works that focus more on emotional resonance or meaning than on fun, often gets dismissed or mocked.
There’s really no clear solution. Over the past five years, the YouTube ecosystem in Korea has gained enormous influence as a form of mass media.
The opinions of certain streamers or reviewers are often accepted as facts or absolute truths, regardless of their accuracy.
A strong tendency toward collectivism over individual thinking also reinforces this pattern.",0.6181498765945435

I'd argue that they do pressure you almost immediately to feel empathy for Abby, very intentionally and strongly, at the start of her part in the game, as well, and even MORE later with the whole Lev and Yara storyline.",0.6106534004211426
comments discussing characters of the game,"After playing, I reflected that Abby should have her own game and not be connected to Ellie's game.
Abby never felt remorse after killing Joel throughout her playthrough..it's as if Developers made an Abby game and forcibly connected Abby to Ellie with the ""Joel killed Abby's father"" plot.
Abby is cool, with her brawling and intense moments. As well as her love story with Owen ( I dont like where Owen cheated however). I like that she is tough and resilient because she goes to the Gym as implied. I like that despite an enemy, she chose to give Lev and Yara a chance and trust them. If the game was just that, its good and fulfilling.
Another is that She helped Yara and Lev because they saved her, why not give that thought with Joel and Tommy saving her? Another is that Abby is relishes in killing a pregnant woman just to get revenge for her pregnant friend...
Abby in her own story makes sense, but with Ellie's story? Plotholes after plotholes emerges.",0.6265013813972473
comments discussing characters of the game,"IMO there's an argument to be made that such a message would be better delivered in a less gameplay heavy game (maybe like a Detroit: Become Human or Life is Strange format), which is a view shared by some relatively more thoughtful Youtubers I watched. One guy I watched said he'd rather watch a long cutscene showing Abby's side than have to play the drawn out combat gameplay segments. In my experience, those long drawn out combat segments dissipated my energy and often left me drained when the next cutscene came around.
Sometimes, the drawn out combat segments, especially the hotel descent section, felt like the cruel embodiment of that phrase some people use against people who sympathize with an opposing side, immigrants, enemies, etc.: ""If you like X so much, why don't you live with them (with all the monotony that accompanies it)."" But no, you don't have to live with someone with all the monotonous moments that would accompany it to sympathize with someone. Such an important message as this game needs to be subtle and not overstay its welcome, which long combat gameplay segments can sometimes go against.",0.6236910820007324
comments discussing characters of the game,"I disagree. Empathizing with Abby is a proposition, a challenge even. It's not a goal in and of itself. If all they wanted to do was have you empathize with her, they would've made the game start with her.
What the game does is to challenge the player to walk a mile in the shoes of someone they hate. Whether you empathize with her or not, or remain stuck in your first impression of her, is up to you. The game being long and draining only plays into the themes and story that is being told, as that's exactly what the characters are going through as well.
If it was a more passive it would be a completely different concept. It's like saying Schindler's List would be a better movie if it had a few jokes to lighten the mood and make it a more palatable experience.
It's a harrowing, uncomfortable, exhausting and unsatisfying journey both for the characters and the player, where ultimately the only payoff is the growth that originates from facing adversity and failure.",0.6359500885009766

comments discussing characters of the game,"As someone who adored the game, I had a few issues with the pacing.
Part of it was due to some gameplay elements/level design, as certain set-pieces could feel a little repetitive. But story-wise, there were points where both Ellie and Abby's Seattle chapters started to drag a little. A not-insignificant chunk of Ellie's Seattle adventures consisted of variations on, ""Go to [place] to find [person]. Oops, [person] is already dead/gone/accidentally killed before they can tell me where Abby is."" There were plenty of important story beats and character moments that happened along the way, but I think some of that could have probably been streamlined or changed up to add a bit more variety.
Similarly, while seeing the WLF from the inside was interesting, Abby's story doesn't really start to pick up momentum until she meets Lev and Yara... and then she leaves them, and we have to fight all the way back through the shipping container area to find them the next morning. I totally get that the abandoning them and the subsequent decision to go back for them is a pivotal moment for Abby's character, and needed to happen... but as with Ellie's sections, there were still moments where I found myself thinking, ""Yes, okay, alright, get on with it!"".",0.621932327747345
comments discussing characters of the game,"A big thing people mention is how it climbs all the way as Ellie up to the theater only for all that tension to be completely cut off as it throws us into playing as Abby and we have to play as her for a solid 12 hours before actually returning to that moment, and by that point yeah theres still tension, but it was just kind of lame to cut that moment off. I would also argue that Joels death happened too soon in the game and came off as more shocking then actually gut punching. It would've been nice just to spend a little more time with Joel, and maybe even play as him more in the first chapter up until he gets killed. Theres only 5 FUCKING MINUTES of playtime as Joel. The story I think is amazing but I think it could've benefited a lot if it spent a bit more time with Joel before he died as well as maybe doing Abby's stuff in the beginning moreso or atleast her origin",0.6182483434677124

comments discussing characters of the game,"Your perspective is so interesting to me, because I have felt since i've played this game that my time spent in therapy definitely colored how I interpreted the themes and plot of the game.
I sort of view the denial of Joel's death, and the very strong reaction to be akin to the grieving of a real person that people felt they lost. I think it shows just how much people love these characters. People see what the game was trying to do, and still don't want to forgive what Abby did. Even though deep down they know it's probably the right thing to do, the anger just feels too difficult to let go of. It's also just really hard to see Ellie struggle like she did. It was a hard game to process. I don't blame anyone who found it too much to go through at some level.
I feel, however, that my years spent in therapy getting over my own angers and hurts and injustices I've felt I've gone through in my life primed me to more readily accept what was happening in the game. Forgiveness is never an easy task and it feels like you're letting the other person off the hook, but that's a facade. That's why the saying goes ""forgiveness is not for the other person, it's for yourself."" You have to remind yourself why you're doing it, and also that it doesn't mean you completely forget about what happened. You just stop holding on to the pain.
The Girlfriend Reviews video for this game said it best ""there is no difficulty setting in the game or in life that makes forgiving someone easier"" and even better ""if you finished the game wishing Ellie killed Abby, you may have won the game you were playing with your controller, but you may have lost the game Naughty Dog was playing with your soul.""
The game is hard because it's like life. Tragic things happen that don't make sense and are needlessly cruel and unfair. To bring that into a game, which is supposed to normally be for escapism, is a ballsy move. Also, life is inherently full of uncertainty. Everyone you meet, and even ourselves, are morally grey characters full of good things and bad things. You play games often to get away from these harsh realities, so for them to put it into a game was bound to be divisive. But I don't personally play video games very often because of that escapism element, they help me run from my problems too much.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I agree so much with your take on the game. It's a masterpiece that makes people feel things in a way most other stories don't (not just games). If there's any artistic justice in the world, games like this will grow to become essential art that gets assigned to high school or college kids like the literary classics of the past. Yeah, I felt negative emotions during this game, but demanding only positive emotions from art is ridiculous. Imagine saying a breakup album is bad because it should have been all happy songs.
I agree that fandom is a problem too, though I'm not sure I agree 100%. It almost feels like your implication is that criticism of a thing by consumers is bad, and only the author can have any valid opinion on what characters would or wouldn't do. I certainly give the author's view precedence over others, but I wouldn't say they're always right by definition. This gets even more complicated when it's a branded thing and the original creator isn't involved. For example, I think the Star Wars prequels are terrible, but you can at least argue that Lucas was involved and the choices carry more weight for that reason. By the time you get to The Last Jedi, the Star Wars brand is really more about selling stuff than telling any kind of story that the creator of it feels must be told.
It seems like the view many fans take is that because something is called X and I identify as a fan of X, the art in question is automatically good if it's labeled as X. I believe this tendency to like anything labeled as X can be worse than the hipster-y tendency to hate things labeled as X because ""I'm a fan of the original X."" It's an especially insidious form of gatekeeping. You see this often in fandoms. ""You're not a real MST3K fan if you don't like Jonah exactly as much as Mike and Joel"" or ""You don't actually like wrestling if you prefer AEW and New Japan over WWE."" (These are admittedly very niche, but I'm sure we've all seen examples of this sort of thing - and maybe been guilty of it ourselves.) No one says those exact words, but they are opinions that can be enforced on a community through actions and implications.
This cuts both ways too. If someone blindly defended this game because ""it's The Last of Us and Neil Druckmann is always right,"" I wouldn't be any more convinced than I am by ""The Last Jedi is brilliant because Star Wars is always right."" Let's argue on the merits. It's always fair to criticize art and, while different people can (and will) come to different views, it's okay to think some art is good and other art is bad. That's how we learn to tell better stories and/or to identify good stories - or, at least, what we believe makes a good story.
I don't think you'd actually disagree with any of that, but I do think there's probably a little bit of space between our views, so hopefully I've articulated it well enough to provide a slightly different perspective.",0.6799508333206177
comments discussing characters of the game,"I think you articulated yourself quite well! It was definitely an interesting perspective. ☺️
I definitely don’t want to imply that criticism from fans or consumers is a bad thing. I do think art is subjective and everyone’s opinion on the material matters. I agree that the creator’s view does take precedence over fan’s desires, but like you stated, it doesn’t make them right. I’m definitely not in the camp of “Neil Druckmann is always right” as that is definitely another unhealthy extreme.
I guess what I was trying to say is that there’s critiquing art and then there’s complaining about “I expected X to happen and it didn’t so this sucks”. I’ve read several reviews for the game, some who give it a 6/10 or so, and I can definitely see where they are coming from! I think there’s several reviews and valid criticisms from fans of the game, but the ones who take it to the extreme of “We wanted this and you didn’t give it to us, so you suck” are, I feel personally, flooding a lot of the negative reviews of this game.
I hope that makes sense? But like you said, I think we agree for the most part. Fandom is a beautiful thing that can definitely be integrated into the art form in some way, but when pleasing fans takes precedence over story, I begin having an issue with that.",0.6483219265937805

comments discussing characters of the game,"Just wanted to add to the chorus of people who appreciate this excellent analysis. Much of what you've said mirrors my experience with the game, and it very much took me a while to wrap my head around everything once it was all over.
I think that while the narrative could have been tightened up when talking about the nitty-gritty (shortening some of Abby's longer sequences is probably the main problem I had with the game), I really enjoyed every single beat to the story. Lots of people seemed to think it was excessive that Ellie left Dina and the farm to go after Abby yet again, but that didn't throw me. I was extremely sad for her that she did it, but I was not surprised. Particularly when you see her PTSD flashback. Indeed, I'm sure that the combination of Joel's death plus the terror of her experiences in Seattle make for a brutal outcome.
I get that pulling together exactly what the narrative is trying to say is not easy. On the surface, it feels like they're just saying ""revenge / violence is BAD"" and hitting the player over the head with it. But after thinking on it, I think there's a lot more going on, even if the overall themes are pretty straightforward. The themes of the first game weren't terribly complicated, either, but it's all about the execution. In the case of Part II, the execution is subtle, masterful, and not at all obvious. It's been over a month since I finished my first play through and I'm still thinking about it (and playing it).",0.6049064993858337

Sure this isn't the narrative I wanted for this sequel, but it's just not executed well at all in my opinion. It would be different if I felt like there was proper build up to some scenes and the characters actually used their brains.
For example, it isn't the fact that Joel dies in this game that makes me mad about the plot. That was heavily implied in trailers, but what does is how unbelievable that scene is and how there is no set up to it. I heard Neil say on a podcast about how Joel is softened due to living in Jackson. That's all well and good but we are never shown for this to be the case in the game. How am I as a fan of the first game supposed to connect the dots there when viewing this scene that he has softened?
What I mean by no setup is that Abby doesn't even have to work to kill Joel she just conveniently meets him when he is on patrol and also conveniently gets Tommy and Joel to come to her cabin with her armed group of friends and gets them to say their names in front of everyone. It feels cheap and unearned as the stars had to align for it to happen.
This leads into my examples of dumb character moments that I don't think PTSD can explain away. Joel and Tommy saying their names and where they live to Abby and company. Even if I were to buy that Joel has softened, Tommy giving out where they live is horribly irresponsible as the WLF could have easily came and raided the settlement for supplies. Abby and co conveniently leave Tommy and Ellie alive to keep the plot of the game alive. This is dumb as they are the only 2 witnesses. Dina going on journey with Ellie despite knowing shes pregnant is just irresponsible. Mel being super pregnant and being on the frontlines. Again irresponsible. Owen and Mel being dumb when confronted by Ellie. They both charge her as she has a gun. Not sure what they thought would happen there. Ellie conveniently drops the map here, and I guess PTSD or trauma can explain why she isn't thinking clearly here, but for Tommy and Jessie to not see it makes it hard to believe. Jessie and Ellie rashly running through the door when they hear Abby in the theater resulting in Jessie's death. Tommy doing a 180 wanting revenge on Abby at the stories end to drive plot other wise he was against it just a little before that. Ellie going all the way to that island to kill Abby only to save her then fight her 2 minutes later. I don't understand why she wouldn't just call it a day when seeing Abby strung up on the pole. The job was already done.",0.6185486316680908
comments discussing characters of the game,"Thanks for the response! I respectfully disagree. I think Ellie120721’s response to your post pretty much articulates what I would say. The primary thing is these characters are in a world of trying to balance survival with re-establishing civilization.
I totally see Joel softening up over time, especially after four years and now focusing his attempts on re-building a relationship with Ellie...and especially with his brother Tommy, who was a former Firefly. Abby leaving Ellie and Tommy alive wasn’t necessarily stupid as her and Owen have their own values and morality which was established in the flashback sequences...again, it’s a balance of survival of the fittest and re-establishing civilization. It’s not always a “that was dumb” scenario because that was the best option from a survivalist standpoint.
Moreover, I think Tommy did end up broken after losing Joel and being shot at, AND losing his wife. It was another example of how emotional pain can impact someone’s life.
And finally, just letting Abby die on the pole wasn’t “enough” for Ellie. She wanted more, but as she saw how broken Abby because she started to become conflicted with her own morals and values that came with seeing Abby helping Lev.
I feel some of the other issues you had with the game were more so from a strategic fighting stand-point (I.e. why did they run through the door, why did Mel and Owen charge Ellie etc.) You’re also getting to the point where you’re blaming Ellie, Tommy, and Jessie for leaving the map after Ellie just got emotional after murdering a pregnant woman.
I guess my point is when it’s life or death, we sometimes don’t think clearly, and a characters mental health and trauma can definitely impact one’s decision making and it’s not something we should minimize.",0.6144759654998779

comments discussing characters of the game,"This was a wonderful read and a great character study of Ellie. I love the level of detail you went into, not only in your analysis of the story but in the various quotes, photos and references you've included in your post. And your style of writing is really lyrical and lovely to read.
I don't have much to add except that I totally agree that while this game may seem to be about hatred and violence, it's more about love, healing and acceptance. I especially like your analysis of the porch scene as signifying the moment where Ellie fully realises the weight of what Joel wanted for her: not just to be his daughter, but to be alive and happy and thriving for her own sake.
What gives a meaning to our life in that kind of society ? And the game cleary give one answer : the love we have for and from others [...] a life of meaning is a life made with someone else
Totally agree. We see it with Jackson, with Ellie and Dina, with Abby and Lev - it's through human connection that people find a way to survive meaningfully in a world like this. And that's what makes these games so heartfelt and compelling, even at the darkest moments, imo - because of those relationships.
I also love your final point that another thing the game shows us is: it's never too late to come back from the edge. You can get lost in the darkness but the light is always there if we can find our way back to it. It's so simple but such a lovely message - no matter what, we always have room to grow and change for the better.",0.6374330520629883

comments discussing characters of the game,"Great write up!
But above all a hatred towards herself, a guilt consuming her from within.
I think this is the most important thing about Ellies psyche that often gets overlooked. In the theater confrontation she says ""Joel did what he did to save me..There is no cure because of me""
To me this suggests that she feels guilt for asking for Joel's love and warming his cold heart. Because if they never cared for each other she would be able to become the savior she wanted to be. Joel would still be alive. That's so tragic, and further explains why Ellie feels unworthy of love for most of the game.",0.6148834228515625

comments discussing characters of the game,"Great post, thank you. I'll throw that back when the next fool comes around with the ""revenge bad"" nonsense. There is so much subtlety and depth to the characters and plot.
That's what the porch scene is about. It's not about forgiveness. It's about Joel learning to Ellie what gives a meaning to life. That her immunity doesn't define her. That a life of meaning is a life made with someone else. And for Ellie, that someone else is Dina.
You mean ""teaching Ellie"", right?
Also I feel it's both, forgiveness and what you said about Joel. I mean she literally spells it out that she is ready to forgive him, that conversation is a huge turning point in their relationship after presumably not speaking for 2 years.
Which, side note, is mindblowing to me. After ALL THAT, only in the last 5 minutes of the game do you really learn what it all meant to Ellie, why she was so unhinged, what Abby really took from her.

The second game is a direct look at that and it's great. People have an issue realising everyone in the game is a gray character so they don't understand the events and life in that world can drive people to extremes.
One I read in this thread was a dude crying about the second character threatening to kill a pregnant girl which makes her unlikeable. You have to understand they live in a perpetual warzone, this is normal shit in that world. It's not evil as much as it's a bargaining tool to win your fight.

Negative reviews are from people who go in expecting entertainment value and escapism. Don’t look at the word escapism as a bad thing. It just means something to take a break from reality to recharge. Almost all games do that. But this isn’t that sort of game and that’s precisely why I liked it so much.
This is a very serious game and requires some patience and processing from the player. It is character driven rather than plot driven. So we need to evaluate the game through the empathy we feel with the characters. That’s where the magic really is.
It’s like reading moby dick or other classic novels.
I would compare it to films like no country for old men. Or even studio ghibli films like princess mononoke.
If you are not used to such films, I suggest watching them and the. Reading online why people like it, the context, etc.
Entertainment is not the focus of the game. But it’s a brilliant one. Definitely a must play.

I wish I could live in the world where so much of the game didn't leak and Twitter poisoned so many against it. I think the conversation would be vastly different and more people would be acceptable to the message the game is trying to convey.",0.6057009696960449

comments discussing characters of the game,"It got review bombed. People giving it 1 or 2 out of 10 are flat out just incorrectly tipping the scale.

I even remember there was a lot of hate from a certain bunch because of “virtue signalling” and “wokeness” in the game, which is just fucking silly. You’ll only ever notice that stuff if you’re actively looking for it, as some people seem to do with anything that has a gay character in it or whatever.
I can definitely see why people didn’t like it, there’s some pretty controversial story beats (I loved the game but I’d have changed the ending a bit), but it’s definitely a game I think everyone should experience and make their own minds up.",0.6468431949615479

comments discussing characters of the game,"While i respect your take at the end of the day Abby's death would have been justice as opposed to revenge. What jole did largely self defence or in defence of others throughout the first game. Abby's father may have had a kind side to him but he was going to risk the life of a girl for a cure which in medicine is unethical and beyond ethics it doesn't guarantee a vaccine. I personally didn't want to play as a person who enjoys torture and then be told that they have a kind heart. Just the hit on Joel was bad enough but a group of people torturing an old man for a justified use of force shows a lack of character on the part of Abby and her crew which doesn't come across through out the game. At the end of the day my take is Ellie should have left them both to die there or atleast killed Abby. Maybe I could get behind abandoning revenge and that's a very big maybe but I certainly can't get behind the narrative favouring Abby as a good human being. Even the worst criminals have a good side and do some good in their life but the overwhelming narrative should not favor the good in them to the exclusion of their bad which is what the game attempts to do. If players reached the conclusion that she was a good person deserving of a second chance that would be fair but to be badgered into such a conclusion leads to a lopsided narrative.
Personally at the end of the game i regretted not only the missed chance to kill her but the sad reality that many people died in our persuit to get to her whose deaths to me could be justified only by killing her.",0.6139563322067261

It makes sense that Ellie is not heterosexual given a few clues in the first game dropped very subtly, as well as the DLC, as well as the obvious choice of Ellen Page as the character design inspiration.
My problem with the game was the pacing. Some areas needed to be dramatically shorter.

comments discussing characters of the game,"[SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE ENTIRE GAME]
I just finished the game and honestly my opinion is basically this: it’s, at best, an okayish game. Not good, not terrible.
I really think they tried to do something different here with the gameplay and the map being just Lumiose, but it’s not well executed.
The gameplay, while refreshing for the first few hours, quickly becomes plain button mashing. Once you get megas, you barely even have to think about move types, it’s all about throwing out the biggest numbers.
The whole “command your Pokémon” mechanic is really janky and sometimes unbearable. Sometimes they run into walls trying to reach the enemy’s Pokémon, then unleash the move at the wall. Big Pokémon, especially alphas, get stuck on anything, and it happens so often it stops being funny. Other times they’ll run across the stage just to launch a move from far away. Just do the attack already, you don’t need to go to the exact spot!
And that huge delay after switching Pokémon, why? I get that it’s for balancing, but sometimes you have to swap because the other one died. Why does the game think it’s okay for the enemy to land a free hit after I already lost a Pokémon? It just feels poorly thought out.
Talking about the story and characters, why is everyone a “good guy”? There are no real villains here. By the end, basically everyone becomes your friend. Even the guy who’s literally a criminal making shady loans that exploit young girls? Even the X/Y villain became a good guy. That’s too much. Why can’t people just be bad anymore? Is sanitizing every story the new trend so nothing ever gets dramatic? That’s ridiculous.
I actually liked Team MZ, especially Naveen and Lida. They had potential, clear goals, great design, cool vibes. But in the end they’re just side characters with zero development. We never see Lida dancing or Naveen’s fashion stuff go anywhere. They just help in battles (barely) and that’s it, which is sad because their designs are flawless.
AZ, on the other hand, was solid. His death at the end was a great and sad conclusion to his arc, although it’s weird that he left everything to children. Then again, after X/Y, maybe he trusts kids more than adults.
Now, Taunie I hated her. Maybe I’m the only one, but she’s selfish, self-centered, and completely out of touch. She takes a loan from shady people, disappears when it’s time to deal with it, and dumps all the consequences on her friends. She doesn’t even try to help, and when everything’s finally solved by you, she cracks jokes about it. I felt like a dumb rug just there to clean up her mess.
And how is she able to keep up with us in the ZA Royale? Our opponents are brutal, but hers are apparently so easy she gets to Rank A in half a day. Sure. Then there’s the Floette thing: why do we even fight her to earn the right to mega evolve if she’s just going to do it anyway? The game literally gives you a line like “I’ll win for the city’s sake,” and it means nothing. And to top it all off, she fails at what she was supposed to do, wrecks the city center, and forces everyone else to deal with her chaos again. Even Naveen and Lida call her out sometimes, but in the next textbox, they’re clapping for her. This is the worst rival in Pokémon history, not because she’s boring or irrelevant, but because she’s insufferable.
The city looks awful. There’s no other way to put it. Almost no NPCs live there, they just stand still. Nobody enters buildings. It’s wild to think Black & White did this better with Castelia City on the DS. Most buildings have no interiors except for story ones. Even the important ones are small and full of locked doors. Some have signs and detailed exteriors that suggest something cool inside, but they’re just big empty boxes. That’s really what the city is: big boxes with flat textures.
Also, why are the wild zones taking up most of the city by the end? Entire neighborhoods are gone. Are we pretending people can just live next to alpha Pokémon now? The story briefly acknowledges this mid-game, but by the end it’s like “nah, it’s fine.” Everyone lost their homes, jobs, and sense of safety, but we’re supposed to accept giant monsters living next door. Okay.
At the end, you’re given three wish options, but only one actually matters. So why even give me the illusion of choice? It’s so bad I just farted.
And yet, I had so much fun. Despite everything, the Pokémon formula still scratches that itch in my brain from when I was a kid, and this one did too. Even with all the frustration, I still got attached to my team and felt happy when things wrapped up. That’s the curse of being a Pokémon fan, the love isn’t logical.
If you like Pokémon, this one’s worth having in your collection. If you’ve never played the series, don’t bother. It’s not a good game. It’s bland, and at best, it’s just okay.
TL;DR: fun but frustrating. Legends ZA tries new ideas but most of them don’t work. Weak story, bad rival, empty city, janky gameplay. Still somehow enjoyable because, well… it’s Pokémon.",0.6090586185455322

Those who have complained with reason however, have cited the existence of lgbtq characters as ""pandering to sjw agenda"", and despite the sexuality of the characters not impacting the gameplay at all, this has been cited as a ""factor that has been focused on, taking away development of the gameplay"" - so I'm sure that if they were to learn of the accessibility settings, they would certainly be considered as wasteful development that could have been put towards gameplay development.
The more of r/thelastofus2 I read, the more I get the distinct impression that ""lack of gameplay development"" = ""No power ups, killstreaks, or airstrikes.""

The show strangely seems to want to do the opposite by making it feel vaguely…stiff and video gamey at times. Like I get the action stuff, but why do that to the character moments?

comments discussing characters of the game,"Crossposting from a comment on /r/television:
I need someone to give me a rundown of what was so good about the writing in this game. I played it once and remember it being fairly rote (til the ending) and perfunctory, nothing about it felt all that complex or inspired.
Where I really thought it shine was in the direction and production. It is a beautiful game with stunning art direction, atmosphere and a fully realised world. Performances were pretty terrific.
But yeah the writing is held up by gamers as being some sort of literary masterpiece, but it's just the same general beats from infinite other post apocalyptic stories, and the characters were incredibly likeable without being all that complex. I honestly barely remember any details about them other than Joel was gruff and Ellie was a kind of resourceful, plucky kid. Are gamers just not that well read or something? I'm so baffled. People acting like this game was written by Shakespeare himself or like Eugene O'Neill or someone.
EDIT: I really gotta expand on this because it's genuinely making me crazy. So, I don't have an English degree. I read a lot, but I'm no Joan Didion. I watch a lot of movies, and I love certain TV shows, particularly shows with richly textured characters like The Sopranos. I recognise good writing when I see it, as many of us do - it's layered, ambiguous, but very specific and truthful, it begins to feel alive after a while, draw you in with things you can relate to and recognise that you otherwise may never have seen. Style is also a factor, and when aiming for something very specific it can all by in the style, like certain scenes or characters in The Sopranos carrying a weight that they wouldn't otherwise if the exact language, phrases and intentions were not accurately portrayed. You BELIEVE in Tony, Christopher, Paulie because you RECOGNISE them, they're real people, they exist. Likewise, the world around them has a pulse, it feels like a self-sustaining organism that exists with or without them. I don't really know if I'm making sense, but what I DO know is that it's probably the greatest written show of all time, though I've never seen the Wire. What I hear, though, is that The Wire is every bit its equal.
I guess what I'm saying is that the more literary, ie. truthful, earnest, ambiguous and yet specific that something like a TV show can be, the more successfully it can dramatise things so minute like pulp in orange juice and use that to build WHOLE LIVES that you come to recognise yourself in... the better the writing, right?
Where on Earth do people get off thinking a kinda awesome zombie game with a likeable duo at the heart of it, killing people with bricks but barely expanding on who they are... is somehow in the upper echelon of works of literary merit? Who truly believes this that aught to know? Anyone? Or is it just fanboys online?
EDIT 2: I also gotta add another little condition of great writing - revelation. The writer actually revealing something they truly believe, have experienced, have gone through, ARE going through that makes the writing that much more pungent and truthful. An honest reflection of internal life as a representation of an external life. Using emotion to fuel imagination and create something real.
Watching The Sopranos with the knowledge that David Chase created it because he ""needed therapy"" and that he based Livia on his mother, you begin to understand why it came out swinging so hard. It really was what he was going through. His NJ upbringing, Tony's struggle to comprehend his own mind, to contend with his demons... it's all a real human being's internal life being dramatised for our enjoyment.
Sam Shepard said ""catharsis is getting rid of something. I'm not trying to get rid of my demons. I want to shake hands with them."" His work is just that - shaking hands with his demons. Some of his darkest thoughts must have gone into his work because he goes to some fucking emotionally harrowing places.
Why do people think Neil Druckmann is some sort of Nobel Laureatte? Even Ann Rice managed to dramatise the loss of a child in her first book and it SHOWS. Where in TLOU has Druckmann told us anything so revealing about himself?

comments discussing characters of the game,"I have been thinking of Kojima this entire time and I'm glad you mentioned him!
Unlike most anyone else whose name is bandied about in relation to the creative direction of any AAA games, Kojima is one of the few (alongside Miyamoto maybe, and some others) whose vision and intentions I take at face value. The man IS inspired by film, but his sandbox is so vast in the gaming sphere that he has fully embraced, transformed and forwarded the entire medium time and again and so why wouldn't he stay in it and be proud of it?
The writing in MGS tends to be batshit crazy, convoluted and nonsensical but it's also incredibly earnest, emotional and creative. It's clearly one man's personal vision. It's not aspiring to be taken seriously. It takes itself seriously enough already that it doesn't need that external validation. It's like that Sam Raimi quote, ""take the material seriously, but not yourself."" Kojima seems to revel in his own imagination, winks at the audience and does things just because he wants to. But he never undermines his own writing. You play MGS and it's very clear that the stakes are VERY high and everyone is VERY invested in the outcome of their own story. But Kojima is having fun. It's terrific stuff.",0.6071103811264038

Gamers don't actually know what is and isn't ""writing,"" because they obviously aren't reading it. The game just had such an incredible level of verisimilitude that they latched onto its storytelling as some sort of work of written genius.

We can say a game is overhyped or hyped in the wrong way without drawing these bizarre conclusions. Every medium has this happen, and all the aspects of a game can be overhyped, not just writing. This is just a general thing with humans.
The fact that you ended that by saying that the game is in fact well-written is just the icing on the cake.",0.6033792495727539
comments discussing characters of the game,"the standard of writing in video games is so low that when something reaches the level of “decent” it’s hailed as a masterpiece of storytelling.
the characters in TLOU (Joel and Ellie) are particularly well-drawn (and very well performed) and it’s really easy to come to love them as you play and go through all of the shit that they go through with them. The attachment to the characters is key because the story is just a jumble of familiar beats and cliches, but when you’re bought in to the characters it becomes very harrowing, and the moral choice at the end gains a degree of emotional power. The final shot of the game is also quite rich with meaning and subtlety in a way most games couldn’t even dream of.
TLDR great characters that many people become attached to and a story that does what it needs to without taking many risks.
Part 2 was a lot more messy, risky, ambitious and took characters in some darker directions which is why it’s much more controversial, especially with fans of the first one.",0.621686577796936
comments discussing characters of the game,"RDR and Uncharted 4 have an argument (an argument I would disagree with for a thousand reasons, but there's an argument), but I wouldn't put the others anywhere near The Last Of Us. Mass Effect is a personality vacuum. If it were produced in any medium other than video games in 2007 it would be considered as the low rent schlock that it is. Neat world and sci Fi premise, writing devoid of any humanity.
TLOU is the opposite. The premise is simple, but the characters are rich. Some of the best fiction ever written is built on that concept.
I'd also point out you talked about how much you loved the characters, but don't remember what they said. That's just your memory haha.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I'm not sure they wanted so much to play as Joel.
He was barely in the promotional materials and there was plenty of speculation, some suggesting he would be dead at the beginning of the game only to appear as a ghost; and some speculation even deeper down the iceberg, that Ellie was hallucinating Joel because the Cordyceps were beginning to actually harm her brain (From her shaky hand in the reveal trailer).
I get being upset about having to play Abby- seems to me that was largely the point; to start loathing Abby and (ideally) learning to sympathize with her character, and to compare her to Ellie.
I also understand why that isn't everybody's cup of tea, but ~5yrs later? That shit is wild.
I used to be a diehard Star Wars fan until The Last Jedi; I wasn't a fan personally, and I bitched and moaned about it for a good long while because it was just really not what I wanted it to be, and I couldn't understand the praise many gave it.
It came up in some unrelated thread recently, and I commented kinda sarcastically, referencing Rian Johnson's penchant for killing characters off screen. The immediate response was asking what specifically I thought made it a bad film.
I could write an essay about what I don't like that movie; but that wasn't the can of worms I wanted to open. I'm glad people enjoy the film the way I enjoy others, I have tried to watch it a few times, but I still feel the same way.
It's such an old argument for me because I had it 5,000 times when it came out- I've seen just about every positive or negative take because I was obsessive; we ain't about to have a new conversation, so what's the use in me whining about everything I've already whined about before?
Live and let live, Don't yuck somebody's yum and all that. I apologize for the lengthy analogy (Which admittedly contains some repeated old whining).

The pacing really didnt do her any favors. I do wonder if Abby would have gone over better if the game played out in chronological order instead of the full split since they didnt even intersect until the very end of day 3 anyway.
I get what they were going for with the jarring transition and I didnt have an issue with it but I can see how it would sour other people.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Yeah I personally feel that the pacing was very intentional in that it sort of emotionally manipulates the player over the course of the game to make its point on the nature of human hate and prejudice.
You play the first half thinking you're on this righteous revenge mission against this villain. Throughout the second half as Abby you're initially pissed you have to play as her but as her story is revealed the intention is that you slowly start to realize her story is just as complicated and morally gray and there really is no true ""righteous"" perspective in this world. It's just a bunch of humans acting like humans while they try to survive.
It hit me hard and I loved it. I think it would be cool to include something like the ability to play in chronological order in subsequent playthroughs but due to the intent of the art I think the first playthrough sort of requires the original pacing.

comments discussing characters of the game,"TLOU2 has showed how immature the fanbase is
Yesterday i was reading a post saying something like “buying TLOU2 for 9,99 dollars was the worst spending of my life: i should have bought toilet paper instead”. Hundreds of like and comment with the same, old hate to the game.
I mean, come on guys… it’s ok if you don’t like the plot of a game, but this “criticism” is beyond any rationality. It’s nothing new, i mean: since the beginning, this game has received A LOT of immotivated hate, simply because of a plot decision (Joel’s death).
This game is by far one of the best of all time, not only for its amazing gameplay and graphics, not only because the wonderful combat system or the true survival horror experience on higher difficulty (i mean, if you like the genre TLOU2 on survivor or grounded is AMAZING). But also because the most hated aspect: the plot. The story of this game is deep and complex, the characters are not “flat” and the game puts you in front of the reality of the non existence of “good” and “evil”, but only of action and consequences. A lot of people hate this game because you play Abby, but this is the best part of this game: you live two stories, you understand both reasons, you empatize with two opposite characters which are also e enemies. The whole point of the game is the relativity of things, a fact that is part of our world and even more of a post-apocaliptic world.
I mean, TLOU2 has its flaws, in both the world setting and plot, like barely every game, but the story of this game is very deep, profound and let you through an emotional amazing experience. With the amazing gameplay and post apocaliptic world exploration, that’s really barely everything you can ask from a game like this!!!
The hate for this game has showed, sadly, how immature the fanbase is: the fact that a complex story, with a gray reality in which there isn’t a clear “good” and a clear “evil”, has create a crisis in those who usually see the reality in black and white. Also, it’s a common part of human nature the fact that we feel being part of a “side” (“team Ellie” or “team Abby”), and trying to open your mind to the “other side” is difficult but it’s part of a person’s maturity. Having to deal with the need of open your mind to the other side, and empatize with a character that you hate for half of the game, is one of the best( if not THE best) aspect of TLOU2, and it should also be considered a pedagogic videogame experience from a psicological and moral point of view.
Maybe, many people still want to play a SuperMario game, with the hero saving the princess killing the incarnation of the evil.
If you don’t like the plot decision to kill Joel i totally understand it (rip Joel ♥️) but overcriticizing and hating this game simply because of this, without considering the whole story and game experience, it’s really a brainless fanbase type of behaviour.
It’s really not a good thing for the future of videogames industry, the fact the people hate this game because it’s a complex story with complex characters and a “two sides” plot.",0.6289142370223999

However, I felt like Abby’s story was a bit forced, not in the way it was told, which I though was very well done, but because her attitude and actions made her feel like two completely different people at times. The game’s storytelling also sort of relies on trying to get you to see Abby’s POV, making a false equivalence between her and Joel’s actions in the first game, making it feel forced at times.
I also don’t think it helped that before release, all trailers pointed towards Dina’s death being what leads Ellie on her trip to Seattle instead of Joel’s, prompting anger among members of the fanbase with the death of a character they were led to believe would be alive during at least most of the game’s events.",0.6332945823669434

comments discussing characters of the game,"There's a history... Prior to the release of the game bits of cinematics were leaked.
There was anger over Joel and because of some rumor's it brought in the whole anti woke crowd specifically with anti trans stuff towards Abby (who was presumed trans). Outrage machine went to work.
Spoilers were not allowed to be discussed in this sub so it was all happening over there. This included one of the mods (no longer there) of that sub helping to organize the review bombing, calling on subs like freefolk.
Anyway, they just kinda didn't stop. Immediately after release it was mostly pictures of TLOU2 stock being on shelves as proof it didn't 'sell out', listing demands to the writer (because Karens exist in gaming too) but eventually that all died down when it transpired that TLOU2 did in fact sell well. Dispersed with this the sub was super anti lgbt and racist / antisemetic , until the 'girlfriend reviews' fake death threats story hit the wider reddit the sub went private and purged most of those posts.
I presume its just less nowadays, but that's why that sub is that way.

However now that they have the formula nailed down and the developers aren't flailing to figure out what the game is on the fly, a sequel could be a lot stronger as it can be built around the first game's design decisions and the storytelling would have a much better framework to be built on.

Of cause you would try to discredit my opinion. I noticed that so much on the subs. Every form of critique has to come with a long disclaimer of how OP has beaten this or that game before they are allowed to criticize.
I have played the metroidvanias. If have played the castlevanias and the metroids that the genre is named after. If have played the rogue likes and the rogue lites. I have played the Hollow Knight games.

comments discussing characters of the game,not really. The objective authority on the game has ruled against you. Your first argument was an ad hominem. Which I am taking up. You now want to avoid the discussion because you got owned.,0.6247639060020447
comments discussing characters of the game,"I haven't made any ad hominems. I'll interact with your argument even though you skipped mine.
Realistically, the devs did nerf the game about 2% with some quality of life tweaks, but it's still really close to their original vision, and not at all indicative of a general downwards trend in difficulty that we could expect with upcoming patches. Team Cherry continues to want the same level of endgame difficulty they released the game on, but are willing to let players ease into it a bit better with earlygame boss nerfs.
I firmly believe the devs consider their movement, and bosses, and exploration to all be individually fun, and do not think of their game as a challenge/effort/improvement = dopamine simulator. I don't really care what the devs think, because my arguments stand on their own ground without needing to reference ""artist's vision"", but if I did care, I also think they would stand against everything you have said.",0.6044641733169556
comments discussing characters of the game,Exactly. In the end you're rooting for the character you despised in the beginning which shows great writing and story telling,0.6047665476799011
comments discussing characters of the game,"I respect your opinion but how was that good writing? Abby has been slaughtering and torturing Scars, Lev's people for years. Why would she have a change of heart within 2 days?
Why did Owen have a change of mind. It's clear that the Scars vs WLF war has been wearing on his mind. That wasn't what they were about. They went from looking to save lives to killing in a faction war. Those are two different life paths. So clearly one isn't what they want.
Why would Lev have a change of heart in 2 days.
It was more Yara than anyone else. It's clear that Yara is the one person that Lev is going to be behind more than anyone else. When Yara tells Lev to cut Abby down she saw something in Abby. On the way to the Hospital you see Lev and Abby slowly starts to see Lev for more than a Scar. Abby see Lev is someone she can save a protect, which is what her life path is. You see her nightmare turn into a happy dream of her father when she save Yara with the medicine.
Weird example but if you left an abusive relationship and your ex was still abusing other people and you know this for a fact but suddenly they have a change of heart and are nice to you for 2 days would you forgive them and trust them and let them back into your life?
This is definitely a weird example because it's trying to force an example to make a point. The game definitely could have developed it more over more days but the game is already a long game, so things had to be condensed.
The through line is there.

As for PVP, as always, it is fun but unbalanced. Cosmic builds, which as I stated in my review are broken in PVE are actually very underpowered in PVP.

comments discussing characters of the game,"This game sold Bioware-style dialogue options in a way that few other game really captured.
In most of this era of RPGs, you make a single choice of who your character is at the start of the game, and then you click that choice every time. You're a jedi this run? Click the blue option. Want to appease your friends? Always pick those options, no matter whether they fit your character or not.
There's a few games that toyed with this concept. Rise of the Argonauts is one - your dialogue choices were linked to the Greek pantheon, and so picking different options appeased different gods and granted you different abilities. That was kinda cool.
But this game married the concept with the spy genre, and it worked. Of course your character is going to flip between different styles of dialogue choices - you're a spy! You're deliberately changing the way you speak to ingratiate yourself to everyone you meet. You're a manipulative sociopath in the same way you are in most RPGs, but this time there's an in-universe reason for it.
The timing stuff was clever too. Forcing you to make choices on the spot, and all that. It made sense in the story and I'm surprised other developers didn't reallt copy it (besides Telltale).

With resources being scarce. You need to take your time, and plan out. Two pistol bullets and a smoke bomb as you pull the generator cord in the basement of the hotel in Pittsburgh for example, or similar when taking on the sniper, etc. Whereas in normal difficulty you can pretty much all enemies as you have several shivs or Molotov cocktails in your inventory.

""Terrible gameplay, mediocre story, meh visuals, framerate drops, too many glitches. 8/10, it has a little something for everyone.""
If you presented some of these 10/10 reviews to me without a score, and asked me to guess what score they gave the game, I'd have to guess somewhere between 78-95, depending on the review. Still a good or great review, just not a top game (well 95 still would be) of all time, based on the review wording.
The unscored reviews also seem to have a more negative tone that the scored ones. Not that they're all extremely negative or anything, but Polygon's review, Kotaku's, Skill Up's, etc. are especially harsh on the story, though I find Polygon's review a bit tedious. Now I think I'll like the game more than SkillUp or these outlets, since I personally liked the combat more than they did.
I'm certain this is still a very good game though, and I can't put down any judgement until I play. But this definitely reminds of a handful of other games that explode to 93-96 review scores, where the reviews themselves seem to be less positive than their score would make you think. If you compare the 100 review scores for this game to some other games with 100 review scores, and used that as a baseline, I would never guess that some of these TLoU2 reviewers gave the game a perfect score.",0.6156728863716125

It is that literally the game itself is preaching to you that violence is bad, but then gives you no other tool but brutally sadistic violence to solve your characters problems. After only giving you that tool to solve your problem with, it then turns around and shames you for doing so and tries to make you feel bad about it.
The ""violence is bad"" message isn't coming form the reviewer, it is coming from the game.
At one point as talked about in the review, it forces you to kill a dog by bashing it's skull in with a pipe, on screen, and then goes into a flashback cutscene of you playing with that dog in order to make you feel bad about it. Like, what does that accomplish? What is that supposed to make me feel, and if it even does successfully make me feel it, did such brutal violence against a dog need to be shown in such graphic detail in order to accomplish it?

comments discussing characters of the game,"You're right, thanks for the correction of terminology, while trying to type out another comment I was trying to find the word for it but my English vocabulary was working against me :P
You're also totally right in saying that neither games had a very good plot.
The first game absolutely made up for it's Cliche plot line with it's incredible immersion in the world and characters, character development, backstories and arcs, atmosphere, emotion, empathy and so on.
The second game on the other hand shot that in the leg within the first hour or two and by the second half of the game destroyed all of it completely and replaced everything that made the first games story so great with a forgettable, dry, dull, husk... and her name is Abby.
If Abby wasn't so unlikeable, boring and had the personality akin to that of a dry paper bag it might have been a slight redemption for the game overall but she is so utterly unlikeable, irritating, boring and apathetic that Naughty Dog might as well have swapped her out for Ted Bundy and the game would feel near identicle, I couldn't care less how many dogs Abby pets or plays fetch with because she's so unappealing as a character I couldn't care less, and it's pretty clear I'm not the only one who feels this way given the state of how much backlash it's faced among players and critics alike.
If you're just playing for the gameplay, sure the game's pretty great and even better throughout Abbies portion of the game, but gameplay alone can't make up for how awful every other aspect of it was and that's why the second game ruined the franchise for me.",0.6125615835189819
comments discussing characters of the game,"You kinda seem like you never got over Abby killing a certain someone or were at least never able to empathize with her situation. Which is odd, because Abby's character is a direct parallel of Joel from the first game.

I don't love Ellie. I understand both of them and I loved being able to play through their story and experience it. I'm sorry that you didn't enjoy it.

comments discussing characters of the game,"It's truly an incredible game if you're willing to be open minded and be challenged.
Are you always this condescending to people who don't like the same things you do or is this just a one off?
I understand the premise of her inclusion and I can absolutely understand the both of them and their motivations for why they did the things they did, but even completely excluding the killing of a certain someone I would still hate Abby as a character because of how utterly unlikeable and fucking boring she is along with her inclusion from the start, calling her 'a parallel of Joel' in the technical story driven sense is one thing, but in a practical sense they're worlds apart.
The fact that she's shoehorned midway through the game and paired with her unlikeability only goes to ruin her backstory because by that point I couldn't care less about her tragic backstory and Naughty Dog pulling all the Cliche strings out to try and make you empathise with her is worthless at best but in reality just feels condesending and forced on you by the developers, I can't empathise with her and not just because I can't understand or forgive her actions earlier in the game (hell I'd do the exact same thing given her circumstances) but moreso because of who she is fundamentally as an entire character and her inclusion to begin with, if they replaced her with someone who was even slightly appealing as a character the game would have an entirely different reception albeit still a pretty bad direction for the plot overall in my opinion.
If you like it, then I'm happy for you, I wish I could say the same but I and many others simply hate the direction the developers decided to take this game and paring it with a character like Abby only emphasised the issue further.",0.6310380697250366

comments discussing characters of the game,"Praise the makers!
We encourage you to continue providing feedback on Discord, Reddit, and Steam by engaging in discussions with fellow sleepers about the things you enjoy and sharing any pain points that affect your gameplay.
This is kind of concerning though, since we all know that people with big opinions are not always aligned with the silent majority. Can you guys maybe roll out some surveys so the quieter voices have a say in the future of the game?
To make those moves easier, we will also introduce what we internally call a Base Backup Tool. This new tool lets you store your entire base, along with nearly all its contents, as an item in your character’s inventory.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I love this game. The game needs battlegrounds and/or faction based combat. This should give the pvpers something to do and a reason to get new gear/farm. It also gives pvers a chance to dip their toe into pvp.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Exactly this. A lot of the criticism is valid, but I'm seeing no praise of where the game is great. They do also need to know what's good so they know what is best to keep. For example, we need to be shouting that the movement is fantastic. Otherwise the people who want COD movement will be the vocal minority, and the devs will potentially patch to cater what is asked for. Basically, you should be giving the pros and cons... Not just the cons.
While the bugs/glitches need to be ironed out, and the game needs bigger maps (which both are a given), I think for the most part we should let them cook. At the end of the day, everyone has different opinions. Where one thing is changed for the better for one person, the next person thinks it's changed for the worse. They've smashed it with each update and are delivering on what we asked for generally speaking with the game as a whole. Let's not slam the devs constantly as they are no doubt working tirelessly to give us the best game they can while under EAs corporate thumb. They've given us the best shooter we've had in years, and no doubt themselves want it to be improved over time. They should be praised for this.
In fairness though, I look at other outlets like Facebook, and the BF threads are generally positive about the game as a whole.

I kinda understand this because, even though I agree with most of the criticism (like 90%), the sheer number of posts and hyperbolic over the top bitching can get exhausting at times.
To make things worse, we get posts like this one which, in my mind, are intended to counter the complaints. Instead they completely dismiss any concerns that the rest of the community may have and they do nothing to further conversations around the game.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I am enjoying it thoroughly. Do I think some things need to change? Sure. But... that's probably every game ever made.
Nothing will make everyone happy. Some people want bigger maps (me), some people want defined lanes and choke points (Metro fans, definitely not me). Some people think bloom needs massive changes, others don't think it's that bad (me).
Overall I am happy, and I'm loving it. But I also do understand that people are review bombing, and I also don't care that much. Because EA understands what is happening (or should). People aren't review bombing because they hate the game, they are doing it to get themselves heard on changes they want.
The game is top 5 played on Steam every single day, EA/DICE can see this. They know these aren't just bad reviews and then people stop playing the game. For example one of the top negative reviews is from someone with 85 hours played and they said this, ""I'll change this to a positive review when an ad for the battlepass isn't the first thing I see when I open the game"".

AND PRO TIP FOR LIFE (this one is for free): Everyone can teach you something. Even the guy who has nothing to do with creating the game could give you plenty of good ideas or schemes that you can implement in your work. Who knows? Maybe that`ll be it.
And your opinion after playing BO and jumpin straight to new BF....Well...no wonder you feel at ""HOME"". Even BF veterans say that this game was made to buy CoD boys.

Some of the best battlefield maps in history have been closer quarter maps with areas focused on high action engagements. For example Operation Metro, easily one of the best BF maps, if not one of the best FPS maps, ever.

comments discussing characters of the game,"So they finally hit the bare minimum of what you would expect from a top series game by 1 of the largest developers in the world. And we should fall at their feet and grovel? Have no issues or complaints at all, because AT LEAST its to some bare minimum standard???
Fuck no.
The game has many minor and some series problems that needs to be addressed and they are taking a long time to address it. It took them a month to dial down some of the most dumb challenges. But they've still done zero about the drone/hammer exploits, we'll they haven't deployed the fix.
They are banning people for ""words"" (in a damn combat game!!) instead of turning off their chat for a week and instead begin banning the drone cheaters. They are prioritizing rolling out stores with tonedeaf skins and not fixing weapons or vehicles.
There are so many things wrong and right with this game and people who have paid AAA price for the product, have a right to complain. We do it because we care and want the product to become better and live long. So its frustrating when Dice only cares about money and clearly dont play their own game nearly enough.
There are so many big corporation apologists and dice simps in here, like you, that it's mind numbing to behold. For every criticism that is posted, 100s of you jump to save the poor big rich corps that got away with mediocre rollout, terrible patch speeds, gating basic content behind ridicolous challenges or purchases etc. Why do you defend them?

Look man the game is great, but it could be better. Main people are happy about all the improvements over past titles. At the same time, there is a loud part of the community that wants to see the game go in a direction that honors past game designs and grows into something that would rival BF3 and BF4.
Vince's DICE has done a great job at recapturing the soul of the BF series, now it just needs some work and heavy hands to stay on track. The DEVs deserve praise for what they have done, but EA / DICE should hear from angry fans if things are not panning out in ways that fans wanted or hoped for. Companies will walk all over your hobbies for monetization, if people want to counter that by being kinda of insanely pissed off in forums and on social media. I say let'em. The game's consumer base is sick of the live service treatments of the past decade, and I'm sick of it too. If a community manager has to look at a shit ton of nonsense so issues are properly conveyed to the team, sure whatever, that's his job he's being paid to have thick skin. No one is asking you to interact with the crazies, no one is gonna stop the crazies, and I promise you they will not make a worse game.
All the critiques I've seen that would have made BF a worse game, come from outside the community to turn BF into something its not. People want a classic experience.

Everyone is having a good time besides those who aren’t playing it. I’m sorry, but not playing a game because it has a few female characters you can change out is goofy and you sound like a child. The maps are small, yes. But I don’t think they are so small that it ruins the game. The gunplay is fantastic. Tanks and air vehicles feel good. It no longer takes a whole squad to kill a tank. I don’t know. I’m loving it, haven’t played any other game since release. The complaints are biased, and coming from 45 year olds who have only played BC2 or BF2 and nothing else. I’m old too, but I’ve realized that games change. Kids would be bored by the games we used to play, and if they were still made that way nobody would buy them.
TLDR; People need to realize that games change over time, and most of the nostalgia we have with these older games is seen through rose colored glasses.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Yeah, OP's absolutely flat out wrong here. In the official podcast, Druckmann talked about the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange. He asked his dad whether it was the right thing to do to trade hundreds of prisoners for a single soldier. His dad replied, ""Are you asking me as the prime minister of Israel or as the father of the soldier? Because those are two very different answers."" If any single group could be singled out as being more likely to agree with Joel's actions, it's parents, who by definition aren't incels, so I don't know what OP's getting at. When he reiterates in Part II, ""I'd do it all over again"" that isn't the writers saying ""Let's remind everyone that he was a terrible person and deserved to die, actually"".
I really get the feeling that OP's the exact opposite of the people they're criticising to the point where they're similarly wrong in hinging their interpretation on identity politics rather than true narrative - fawning over the fact that there are lesbians represented and the man gets justice by being killed by a woman, Jesse and Owen only existing to atone for the problematic previous generation - rather than embracing the fact that the game's entire story exists within a realistically dark world that explores human nature, love and war, and survival. I'm not going all enlightened centrist here, but OP's review seems to be ""the entire game is based around identity politics but unlike the incels I think those politics are good, actually"". They miss the story the same way that the people OP complains about do by completely disregarding the story itself and the grim reality of the decisions characters are constantly forced to make in the world of TLOU and focussing on ""omg they put lesbians in a AAA game this is amazing!""",0.6080002784729004
comments discussing characters of the game,"Nice review, it's nice to see that inclusivity mattered.
I would just like to remind you that there's no black and white as to why people dislike the game's story. There's a vocal minority of incels bashing the game for a handful of reasons, but there's plenty of people that have gripes with the story and their gripes are kinda believable and have nothing to do with LGBTQ representation.
I've always been middle ground, I think TLOU2 is a superb game that anybody needs to experience and I'm happy I played it, but it didn't resonate with me the way the first game did.
It might be because I'm a cishet white male, but I don't think so, I'm definitely not an incel. I've never been bothered by LGBTQ representation, the more the better. My main issue is that I didn't like Abby that much as a character. Not because ""she killed my beloved Joel!1!1!!"", not because she was a muscle woman, just because I didn't like her attitude, her way of dealing with problems. I did think that her side of the story went on for a little bit too long and deviated from what, for me, was the fulcrum of the story.
But TLOU2 is still a gripping, tight, wonderful game deserving of all the possible praise.
The thing is, people who didn't like the game and aren't sad homophobic incels are actually much more than you might think, and are open for dialogue and bashing them by grouping them together with a very loud minority isn't really fair and it generally leads to the usual back and forth
""I like the game, people who don't like it are homophobes""

I love TLOU2's Grounded difficulty, and shockingly, I have 154 hours clocked. My only issue with the story is its pacing. It's fine during Ellie's half. But then things sort of tank during Abby's story, when you're hit with dozens of flashbacks and slow walking cutscenes. NakeyJakey had a pretty solid review even though I disagree with some of his criticisms.

Marlene knew who he was because she knew Tommy when he was a Firefly. Presumably other Firefly's would also know who Tommy was, and might also know who Joel was as a result.

I had a much different interpretation of the flash image she had of Joel at that point. I didn’t think it meant there was more to life than Joel - I thought it was a reminder to Ellie of what Joel would think of her in that moment, and the thought of letting him down (murdering Abby and leaving Lev to die) stopped her before finishing.
Generally, I’m disappointed that people are trashing this game.

Her remembering Joel, thinking about the relationship they had, could've also led her to think about Abby and Lev's relationship (when Ellie lets Abby go, she explicitly tells her to take Lev, so we know he's at least in her thoughts, even given the intensity of the situation). And if she's thinking of Lev, she's sure to remember that he saved her and Dina when Abby was ready to end it.
I agree with you about the quality of the story.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I've posted this elsewhere but a huge theme of the story is overcoming bias. Getting to know Abby too much before THAT scene would completely defeat the purpose of the theme. We are supposed to have extreme bias and hatred for her throughout most the game in the same way Ellie does. The order of the presentation is intentional as a way to say ""okay you have your bias, but here is some new information"" and the challenge to you as a player from then on is to be able to overcome that bias and view things more objectively.
You may or may not, and it's okay because a narrative like this is supposed to make different players feel different ways. Some were able to overcome that bias fully and root for Abby, even to the point of rooting for her more so than Ellie. Others were still die hard team Ellie and wanted to see Abby dead at the end despite that not being what would have been best for Ellie. Then you have some people that are 50/50.

The vengeance aspect is the more overt one and deals only with the characters, but the bias aspect involves both the characters and the players. The first time we see Abby we obviously have a deep bias against her and the later narrative puts all the chips on the table to challenge us to overcome it in the same way it asks Ellie to.
And IIRC when we first see Scars (Seraphites!) They are stringing up some dude and gutting him and nail Ellie with an arrow so again we have an extreme bias against them. But then we later meet Lev and Yara and embark on the journey of overcoming that particular bias with Abby.

I think what they could have done is actually side track the revenge at the rattlers and they have to team up to escape.

There are so many reasons why Ellie let Abby go in the end, and I think the single frame of Joel in her mind is so beautiful. You can say she let Abby go because she finally realized that all this hurt is unproductive. You can say she let her go because maybe, like that old Seraphite, she was just tired of fighting. Maybe it was because Lev saved her, and the bond between Lev and Abby reminded her so much of her bond with Joel.

I feel like a lot of people who are hating on Abby are missing the entire point... like you said, you don't necessarily have to like her, but asking yourself why you can't even sympathize with her reveals the brilliance of the plot.
I've seen a lot of people asking 'why didn't Ellie finish the job at the end?' but not once have I seen 'why did Abby not finish Ellie in the theater?' I think it's because people want to see Ellie win, and they want to see Abby die. Abby had already let Ellie live once, and yet she still did it again after Ellie wasted it. Abby had a hell of a lot more reason to kill Ellie than vice versa. Yet, people seem to only feel that Ellie missed her chance to get justice/revenge.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I understand your perspective but respectfully disagree. As Abby I was itching to get back to Ellie in the moment but I could appreciate where it was going. In retrospect it was well worth the journey to me.
Spending so much time with her wasnt meant to make you root for her. It was meant to make you question why you weren't rooting for her. Had we played as Abby from the start of the series and changed nothing else that any of the other character did or experienced, we would definitely be rooting for her finally getting her revenge on Joel and then her later revenge on Ellie after she murdered Mel and Owen.
We had every reason to root for Abby the same as we did for Ellie, but we didnt root for Abby. I think it is a very intriguing commentary on our bias as gamers/media consumers and who we consider heroes, villains, righteous, unjust, etc
And I dont think it is a toothless revenge tale at all. Ellie needed to make the choice she did. Otherwise she is exactly the same, but even more lost and broken, Joel is still dead, etc. All of her loss is still there but her choice showed a change that will lead her back to healing. The only difference is one choice will cause irreparable damage and the other will lead to eventual healing.

Not bashing the game but I really wanna know how Ellie sparing Abby means forgiving Joel? I didn't really get that part.

Obviously. It was Joel who started this shit and I feel like even the game is telling that Ellie and Joel are villains(and I agree with it). I know Abby was a good person, and hats why she is one of my favorite characters from the game. But I seriously hated Ellie, like, just on the level of Joel from part 1. Joel in this game was kinda redeemable but I just can't forget what he did in the first game. But they really ruined Ellie for me.

I agree with Lev being used more as a vehicle than a true fleshy character but I think we got enough for that storyline to hit. At least for me.
Regarding Ellie's reconciliation with Dina, the ONLY reason I say that is because the missing painting from the art room in the farm house. I think it is a subtle indication that there is still hope for that relationship.
I really, really hope that if they are gonna do a third game it is a completely new story and new cast set in the same world. I think we've lived with these characters enough and I'm good with that.

the neighborhood you creep through in Seattle Day 1 as Ellie is such an amazing playground to sneak through, stealth kill, or ambush, retreat, and hide.

comments discussing characters of the game,"This is exactly my thoughts! I can't even explain how confused I was when I got online to see people destroy this game. Everyone immediately hating Abby for doing what she did when the game goes through extreme length to make you understand that Abby is feeling how we felt when Joel was taken from Ellie or when Sarah was taken from Joel. The fact that people just missed this point because they stan Joel so much is kind of upsetting. Obviously it's hard to see Joel go this way and that's why the first half is just rage from the player. Until you find out that Joel's selfishness got someone's loved one killed. Abby shared the same moment of calamity that Joel and Ellie did with the Giraffes. How come Abby isn't allowed revenge? Because she's not Joel? Just doesn't seem fair to me. Abby didn't ask for her father to be shot in cold blood for just doing his job just like Joel didn't ask to be shot by a soldier for just trying to find safety for his little girl. Life dealt both these people a bad hand and they reacted the same way anyone would.
Id be enraged if I was Abby. I'd spend every day of life preparing for Joel. I'd be chasing every lead I could to find the man that killed my dad. I'd chase him down and I'd kill him. Joel is such an amazing character but he made selfish choice that got innocent people killed and it came back for him. I genuinely think this game is a masterpiece. I'm not finished yet but I am constantly at awe at its presentation and storytelling. I hate this narrative that characters were 'assassinated' to fit some made up agenda. Every character behaves the same way they did in the first game. Joel is a tad disillusioned (as you mentioned) but the flashbacks show that Joel is still his old self. The 4 years in Jackson changed him. I agree completely man. Well said.",0.6274523735046387
comments discussing characters of the game,"I agree with you on pretty much every front. The gameplay I thought was monotonous but that’s largely just because it’s not quite my cup of tea. The characters all felt incredibly real and well written apart from maybe I thought some of Abby’s friends might have tried to save themselves. Especially Mel/Owen.
Naughtydog was clearly drawing parallels between Ellie and Abby showing that they both have reasons for what they’re doing even if they aren’t justifiable and that there aren’t really correct choices sometimes.
I come from a position where I never really played or saw the first game but the controversy made me check out the second all the while waiting for this awful twist where the story becomes horrible considering what I heard and that just never came to pass.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I've not played the game as I don't have a PS but watched both games through YouTube playthroughs and I actually think it gave me a unique perspective. I adored the story (I thought the gameplay looked fine but obviously can't judge as I didn't play it myself and some said it gets repetitive). But I understand the hate now. I think this is the most ambitious and divisive possible way to have made the sequel and I give props to Naughty Dog for that. However, others who actually had to play as Abby for half the game and didn't like her..... Jesus I feel sorry for them.
As a passive viewer, this was one of the greatest experiences I've ever got from gaming (like the first one was) but for all the fan boys who worshipped Joel for 7 years and dreamed of their sequel, I sincerely hope they all emotionally recover because this game will get a very different reception in 10 years without the hype and with both games being played back to back like you did. I'm not picking sides purely based on future predictions but I do think the game will have so much more appreciation in about 5 years minimum.
Regarding common complaints about the story, I think on paper as a script the story is undoubtedly amazing but the way it is presented and how the gamer interacts with it can completely go the other way. People say Joel's death was unrealistic but he did trust several people in the first game (everyone just talks about the one fake injury man) and also gave his name willingly multiple times. The idea he wouldn't have trusted Abby (short term) considering the situation of the horde and blizzard, is utterly ridiculous and a sign of people who just can't accept that Joel died. It's like my 4 year mourning period over (GAME OF THRONES SPOILER ALERT) Stannis when I just kept saying it was terrible writing. Then after watching it all again and ignoring the books, I thought the arc was incredible despite the pain the viewer experiences. People who just say Abby is a ""weak character"" with no basis are obviously biased because they just don't like her.
However, there are many real story and gameplay criticisms that are valid opinions and I can see scores for this ranging realistically from 5 to 10 out of 10. I would call this a 10 and my favourite example of true artistry and risk in gaming but some others will hate it and call it 5. That is life. I love watching the shit storm online. This is living in the times of the premieres of Beethoven's Grosse Fugue or Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. Not saying TLOU2 is a genius masterpiece and will be hailed by everyone in 10 years but it will keep growing in appreciation and people will always remember the controversy at release. Some people still hate those music pieces today and some will hate TLOU2 in 10 years. But I hope I won't get lynched online in the future for just saying I actually loved the story.",0.6368089318275452

3: people with 7 years worth of hopes and dreams for their head canon of how the story should unfold. Essentially they wanted more of the same. But this game had to be bigger and more ambitious than even the first and it had to do things differently. I think it paid off in spades.
4: then there's people overly attached to the characters. And I 100% understand this because I am too.

There is very clear symbolism if you examine the scene.
Joel effectively represents the player, having been the player character of the previous game.
Abby represents Neil Druckmann, since she is the Mary Sue of the game.
The golf club represents a golf club.

comments discussing characters of the game,"The original word used in the review was “미온적,” which means “lukewarm.”
As you said, the gruesome death of Joel worked as intended and filled both the player and Ellie with rage, but I think Neil Druckmann underestimated just how much of rage the disrespectful way of death could induce in the player.
I think what he meant by the word is that: Ellie was seeing red as much as the player did at the beginning of the journey, but you can see her getting gradually shaken up from killing Abby’s friends, although the players who loved Joel remain just as angry and would murder most of them in cold blood. So I chose the word “dispassionate,” in the sense that Ellie’s not really as passionate about revenge as the player, but if you can think of any better word, please let me know and I’ll make a change.
Also the word refers to some of the scenes where she gets all lovey dovey with Dina in the middle of her quest for vengeance, which some of the players found absurd. (He mentions this point in the video.)

I don’t give a crap about Druckman and SJW stuff lol. I played the game without thinking about any of that once. It’s just odd how a lot of reviews have to get into Druckman trying to harass the player... maybe it’s because I’m not attached to the first game like a lot of people but i never felt like it was Druckman and ND going after me as the player in that lodge scene. It was more or less to inflict a similar trauma/ ptsd on the player as Ellie has going forward.
I saw a good take from someone in relation to the backlash from the opening bit. If the game miraculously came out closer to the first game, the reaction would be so much tamer. But 7 years to dwell on where the story will go, creates a stronger artificial bond to these artificial characters lol. I wasn’t a big fan of the first, just liked it, so I didn’t end up thinking about where a sequel would go at all. Started this game and once that scene happened, I was pissed the fuck off but I understood as I did kind of see it coming. They just didn’t do a cowboy-esque send off.

well there you go, there's your reason :p
i dunno man, this reviewer does not seem that attached to the first game.
the second game does have things going for it, it has a lot of interesting concepts, but for me i feel as though it changed and mutilated the characters to get them across.

comments discussing characters of the game,"The reviewer may not have had an attachment to the first game but that whole rant about ND and Neil in the second half is still weird as shit. He keeps saying “the story isn’t the problem”, to weasel into pointing fingers at Neil wanting to attack the player. There are criticisms of the game’s choice in narrative structure, ways things could have been moved around, it’s about 4-6 hours too long, could have condensed several areas together to shave this. But this review wants to discuss Neil. Not the product lol
Also mutilating characters? They kind of die the way this world would dictate. Like shits just not fair for anyone. It’s fine if you want some hope, but you can find this type of character “death” and despair in tons of movies, tv shows and books, well regarded or hated. It’s common in those mediums. It’s just never done in a game because they generally focus on a larger than life style protagonist and never stray from this.
And I doubt they’d return to Abby and Lev in a sequel. Abby did kind of face her consequence, lost everyone she cared for because she was hell bent on going to Jackson. The point of Abby and Lev really was was to show where Ellie will end up once she seeks out, and gets her revenge, still traumatized and unsatisfied, but there is still a way for her to overcome the grief and grow. That was the necessity for Abby. Nothing to do with forcing sympathy",0.6436331272125244
comments discussing characters of the game,"I suppose it's ultimately all subjective, but personally for me, the time between releases didn't make that much difference.

I don't want to throw personal insults or anything with this upcoming point, but I also didn't like TLJ. Maybe the people who like this game and enjoyed TLJ find satisfaction in some combination of story writing/world building that actively destroys characters? I wouldn't even say this game destroys characters in the worst way possible because of bad writing (which I do think it has its share of) but story-wise it does. People for sure can, and do, enjoy the fact that the game destroys these beloved works of fiction, which is fine, but I and a lot of other people don't.

As for the use of word “vice”, that was a poor choice of a word on my part. I couldn’t find the exact translation of the original word (“악취미”) but if you find that vice has too strong of a meaning, I’ll change it to something else in the original post. In my defense, I chose the word vice because he quotes a line from Togashi Yoshihiro’s Yu Yu Hakusho right before that part, where he says the scene reminded him of the said line which roughly reads “the dirty pleasure derived from thinking of showing an uncensored pornography to a innocent girl.”",0.6151322722434998

If you didn't know he was talking about a video game and it's director you'd think the guy had something personally done to him by Neil.

Thats what a difference of opinion is.
I find that those who feel the way that you do are mostly latecomers to the series.
I guess drastic changes to character dynamics and a less interesting story are easier to swallow if you aren't very invested in the franchise from the off.
I assume you are a fan of other franchises and are invested in the characters and lore?
Think of your favourite film series or game series.
Now imagine if the next installment to that series took nearly a decade to come out, and when it did, it looked and felt near identical (albeit better looking) to the last installment and no real innovation had taken place.
Then imagine the characters you know and love were rewritten to be nothing like they were up to this point and one of the main protagonists is killed off early in the first act, merely to make way for a new character. Then, In order to ingratiate this new character to the audience, you are forced to watch/play as said new character for 1/3 of the time.....in a piece of media....you have waited nearly 10 years....to get hold of.
Then imagine that the reputation and drivers of the character that was killed were tarnished and vilified in order to further the idea that this new character is the real 'hero' in the story. Even though you have replayed the previous installment over and over and the thematic was centred around moralistic shades of grey and self serving actions in the name of love and endearment, you are now forced to disregard this in order to make the new piece fit.
Many hate the game because it takes a dump on the first one.
It would have been better if they told a completely new story, centered around completely new characters, but that would not have duped idiots like me to hand over money for more time with ellie and joel.",0.660760223865509
comments discussing characters of the game,"First of all, your condescending tone is super off putting.
I don't need to imagine anything, I played the first game when it came out, I played it again when it was remastered and I played it again directly before playing part ii. So to talk down to me like I'm a simpleton who couldn't possibly understand what playing part ii is like cuz I'm not invested enough is pretty gross.
Secondly, I just flat our disagree with you. It in no way takes a dump on the first game. I love Joel, but he's not an objective hero. It makes sense he's seen as the villain to someone else.
I didn't need any drastic gameplay changes, they refined all the mechanics of the first, it felt familiar, but exponentially smoother. Shooting was better, crafting was smoother, weapons and attachments were deeper. I didn't want a whole new game, I wanted more of the same simple systems, but improved.
What I feel like people of your opinion fail to acknowledge, is that people change. If Ellie was exactly the same person as she was in part 1, that'd be weird.
Killing Joel early is just good writing. It creates real emotion. Ellie was robbed of more time with him and so were we. It made is us angry, it made us sad, we felt real loss. No other game I've ever played as made me feel that. To me that's an achievement in itself.
I hated the wolves, I hated Abby, it made going into Seattle and killing them all especially satisfying. But to then suddenly play as Abby, see her perspective, realize she's not some evil super villain, to force me to question my own feelings about her and feel conflicted about the 'bad guy' also amazing. I'm so sold on how I feel, so comfortable in my anger and hate and then to suddenly have to come to terms with reevaluating that?! Wow.
I don't know why you think you have to disregard your affection for Joel in order to accept Abby. His reputation isn't tarnished and abby isn't this all out ""hero"". They're all 3 deeply flawed people who have made mistakes and done the wrong thing, but all ultimately want to be and are good people.
You talk about moral grey areas and self serving actions being the theme of part I but fail to recognize those exact same themes in part ii.
I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it, and I'm happy to discuss further, as I love this game and series and enjoy talking about it, but fuck off with that condescending, self righteous tone, I'm not interested in that bullshit.",0.6165059804916382
comments discussing characters of the game,"Right, i did not intend to patronise you. Having said that, the tone of my statement has absolutely no bearing to the point i was attempting to make.
At no point was i rude, nor did i direct profanity toward you. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about your response.
You cannot offer further discourse and prefix it with an ultimatum of 'fucking off' if the perceived tone is not to your liking.
As for your points, as i said, it is an opinion, and a criticism of the game is no less valid than your veneration.
You are more than entitled to disagree, i was under no assumption that your opinion would change upon reading my response.
You stated that you played the first game directly before the second, inferring that this is when you first played it. That is why i said what i did, not because i believed you to be a 'simpleton' , though the passive aggressive nature of your response gives me pause to reconsider.
If you are happy with little in the way of innovation with a near decade gap between the two titles, that is your perogative. I, however was beyond disappointed. The trailers alluded changes that were nothing more than clever animations
As for the dramatic personality shift regarding characters, ellie is not the issue. Joel is.
Elle was in her formative years in the first game. Joel was not.
The first game presents us with a man who has survived in the world as it is for 20 years, a man who has done unsavoury things to survive. A man who knows all too well that irrespective of 'stability' strangers can rarely be trusted.
4 years later we find a man who is all too happy to follow strangers nocehaltly into a trap and offer his identity and base location to anyone he meets.
Such a drastic change is not only unbelievable, it is unearned.
By all accounts, the world is very much the same as it was 4 years earlier, hence the patrols.
Killing joel at all was little more than a cheap attempt at eliciting an emotional response from the player.
Killing joel early, was in no way 'good writing', it was done to set up a new deuteragonist, push a new protagonist and to delegitimise and usurp the old protagonist.
Elle ends the game believing joel to be the 'bad guy', christ, this is alluded to part way through the game via flashbacks, so i'm not buying the 'robbed' aspect.
It neither made me sad or a sense of loss. It made me sigh. It was entirely predictable and elicited no emotion other than the feeling of being cheated, and a disbelieve that the writers could think of no motivation other than joels death to propagate an arc for ellie in her own right.
Abby's motivation was boring, predictable, and her insertion into the narrative felt forced.
Her father was going to murder a child, she spurred him on, and he was killed by a man who was threatened with death if he attempted to stop said murder.
So, so deep.
Abby's entire arc was contrived to the point of ridiculousness. There was no moral ambiguity in her action. She was just a 'good person, forced to do bad things'. Ellie is painted in a far more unsavoury light than abby.
I never said you had to disregard affection for joel to accept abby. When you position a new playable character as the murderer of the previous one, it is somewhat difficult to warm to them irrespective of backstory.
There is little in the way of shades of grey with abbys story, and ellie is out for basic revenge, and comes to realise that joel wasn't such a great guy. Thats as deep as moralistic postulation gets in this title.
Abby learns no lesson, has no epiphany and generally gets what she wants, save some of her friends dying.
Yes ellie breaks the 'cycle of revenge' but racks up a mound of bodies in the process.
The game is, in my view, a poor and cheap attempt at imitating the first.
Unfortunately the writing talent had jumped ship mid way through and to me it is evident",0.6071995496749878
comments discussing characters of the game,"Well, not gonna go back and forth with you, but my opinion is you're viewing the entire thing from the wrong perspective. There is no hero, everyone is in the wrong, they all make mistakes. Abby clearly learns killing isn't the answer. Ellie may kill a ton of people, but it took that experience to end that cycle. I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it, but I've never had a more enjoyable gaming experience.",0.6358103156089783
comments discussing characters of the game,"I never stated i viewed it from ANY perspective, let alone an identifiable 'hero'.
I used the term 'hero' sarcastically to draw attention to the fact that Abby is the only character who's actions are neigh unambiguous and are deemed (based on her portrayal) to be morally defensible/justifiable.
Abby learns nothing. She equates justice with retribution, as does her group, and this stance does not change. The end of the game shows Abby 'walking off into the sunset' safe in the knowledge that 'justice' has been served. There is no introspection of her actions and no doubt as to whether killing joel was really the right thing to do.
Elle knew what joel had done before Abby even showed up. She knew why she was there but she went after her anyway. Abby even points out the 'mercy' she showed her by sparing her life and alludes to the idea of 'justice' being served, not revenge 'blah blah blah'.
Based on Abby's motivation and the thematic of the game, each of them has probably created 100's of circles of revenge to be played out upon them at a later date. How many brothers, sisters, uncles, wifes, aunts, children did they both butcher in the name of vengeance/justice.
The moral lesson that the game attempts to tell falls flat due to the fact that it affords the player no option to NOT pick murder for either character.
The game has objective nararrative issues and contradicts itself on multiple occasions.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I've seen people mad about everything from Joel being killed and that it's just a basic, boring revenge story, to hating having to play as Abby and anger Ellie let her live at the end. They claim the writing was 'dogshit' and a 'dumpster fire' and how they ruined all the characters people loved from the first game and this could not be further from reality.
The only thing more brilliant than killing Joel, was forcing us to play as his killer. Games (and many movies) paint the bad guy as an evil villain who only 'wants to watch the world burn'. Not often enough are we given a chance to understand the 'villain', and to learn they really arn't a villain at all
This game is a shining masterpiece of story telling, emotion, internal conflict and perspective and I cannot wrap my mind around seeing this is a failure, dumpster fire or a story than ruined characters we love.
Revenge doesnt really solve anything. It doesn't bring Joel back, or Abby's father. It's a lose-lose for everyone involved.
I don't want to get into arguments, but I am genuinely interested in why people didn't like this game, or hated it other than ''its trash and they ruined everything, what a failure"". Explain yourselves, please, I am soo curious.
How does that work: you don't want to get into discussions and yet you want to hear why people dislike it when you yourself did like it?
I didn't play either one, and I only watched reviews of the second, but that alone did give sufficient insights of how the story and especially characters went downhill, and besides the usual suspects of a broken game full of bugs, lacking or non-existing UI/UX etc. characters who either break with their previously established character or who are making utterly fucking weird decision, which are only there to serve as plot devices, will almost always annihilate my enjoyment of the story and thus of the game:
Joel as a character went from being an overly cautious and mistrusting character in TLoU1 to someone who freely goes to/invites(can't recall which) random people he didn't know and would've freely given his ID card with his current home address if asked -> complete 180° in terms of his character as the universe they games are in is still the same with everyone trying their best to survive - and the excuses I've read along the lines of ""He was just getting tired after all this time"" or ""He was getting complacent"" are making no fucking sense considering his previously established character + them all still being in the same universe
Didn't Joel save Abby, and as a reward he was clubbed to death?
Wasn't it a deliberate act that Ellie e.g. could kill every dog in her vicinity, while only Abby was allowed to play with them -> pathetic attempts at emotional manipulation to make Abby look good in comparison to Ellie and ""justify"" her killing Joel or rather warm the player up to liking her character
Isn't the touted scope of the game, ""Revenge is bad"", utter bullshit when you kill/can kill(not sure) most characters you meet as Ellie and yet Ellie lets Abby go without killing her, the one who killed her Joel? Makes no fucking sense
From an onlooker's perspective:
They had to use the death of a main character as a cheap plot device to keep the story going because they lacked the skills or ideas to move the story forward in other ways
They had no idea how to properly kill off one of their main characters as there was little to no build-up, and overall it made close to 0 sense
The ""Having to play the bad guy and thus the player will sympathize with him"" plot device doesn't work at all in a game which completely breaks with previously established characters just to create said bad guy - and it only makes thing worse if the game is designed to emotionally manipulate the player into tolerating/liking the bad guy after he did something bad by capitalizing on a well-established character completely breaking his previously established character and doing a 180° by making an utterly fucking stupid decision which makes 0 sense",0.609181821346283
comments discussing characters of the game,"i said i didnt want to get into arguments. people have been pretty nasty when talking about this game and i just wanted to have a discussion, not get cussed out online.
granted i played the game months after release, i didnt hear anything about bugs or UI problems. my playthrough was as technically sound as any game i've ever played. the UI/UX was everything i needed it to be while being minimal as possible. the presentation and transition from cut scenes to live gameplay was smooth and as seamless as i've seen since God of War.
Joel was overly cautious in part 1, but they were also being chased by a hoard of infected and if they didnt flee with abby to their cabin, they all would have died from the infected. also, people make mistakes, which i think is a major theme of the game overall. there's a also a difference between a grown man in the middle of the road claiming his car broke down (as a trap for an ambush in the first game) and seeing a teenage girl with an infected on top of her. was this the absolute strongest possible way to get abby to joel, maybe not, but is is far from game breaking.
joel did save abby, but in the eyes of a child who's father was murdered, i'm not sure that all is just immediately forgiven. abby was consumed by revenge, she spent 4 years training to be a killer and ruined relationships in favor of following leads and then traveled nearly 1000 miles in the winter to find joel. upon suddenly hearing his name and realizing who he was, i can only imagine all the years of pent up hate and anger came rushing forward and the idea he saved her was the last thing on her mind.
i think you're reading too much into the dog thing. ellie was fighting the WLF, who had dogs. abby was part of the WLF, who had dogs. it seemed far more like a new game play mechanic to add enemies who could track your movement than some ploy to make ellie less likable. with or without dogs, abby was justified in killing joel, from her perspective.
the them is revenge is bad, but forgiveness, salvation and redemption are also themes. i was especially relieved when ellie let abby go. the game had made its point, everything abby was close to died because of her actions. abby also lost a close friend in jesse and ultimately her girlfriend and family for continuing to go after abby. ellie was only ever able to see joel in her mind being killed and it wasnt until she let the cycle of violence go, that she was able to see joel happy and alive in her mind. after all the killing, all the PTSD, everything she realized it didnt get her anywhere. as abby was seconds from death, she didnt feel better. what better way to say ''revenge is bad'' than to show her only personal salvation coming by letting the revenge go?
i dont see killing a main character as a cheap plot device, i see it as emotional motivation to carry out a story about revenge. joel was a beloved character, but ultimately, a fairly boring one. his arc was the highlight of the first game, from cold ruthless killer to redeemed father figure. just as in game of thrones, killing a loved main character leaves far more interesting options than basing the game around him again. his absents creates a vacuum that is far more interesting to fill.
they did the build up in reverse through flashbacks and having played the first game, once you know abby is jerry's daughter there's plenty of build up knowing joel killed him. creating a tragic and shocking moment early in the game sets the stage for a raw, emotional journey and creates instant hate for abby. they wanted you hate abby intensely which leads into my next point:
hating abby as much as i did and then being made to play her i dont see as manipulation, i see it as understanding and empathizing. joel was the villain of abby's story and eventhough she savagely killed joel, you can't play as her for 10 hours and not at least understand where that came from. i went from hating her so much, and feeling motivated to kill anyone in ellie's way to get to her, to genuinely hoping she survived at the end. i see that as an emotional journey, rather than manipulation. people were free to continue to hate her, but at least the game gave you the information to decide for yourself. i do see an argument for giving the player a choice whether or not kill abby at the end. however, letting abby live wasn't about abby, it was about ellie. if ellie had killed abby, she'd be lost emotionally forever. by sparing abby, it spared ellie.
and i assume by breaking with previously established characters, you mean ellie not being a hardened killer in the first game. well, i'd imagine watching your father beaten to death with a golf club would change a person. abby didnt even see her father killed and it certainly changed her into a killer, blood thirst for revenge, at the cost of everyone around her. i also think ellie learning the truth about joel taking her out of the hospital changed her. she specifically told joel she didnt want her life to mean nothing and when she found out joel prevented her life from potentially saving humanity, that changed her too. even before joel's death, during the opening of the second game, you could already feel ellie's shift in personality. she's 4 years older, had been through hell and felt like she had little to live for/that her life's purpose was taken from her.",0.639315664768219
comments discussing characters of the game,"also, people make mistakes, which i think is a major theme of the game overall.
Like what?
You are actually fine with a character that was overly cautious and mistrusting to throw all that out of the window and meet with random people he never met before and call it a ""mistake""?
i think you're reading too much into the dog thing.
Like what?
I don't have the games to verify it, but from what I've seen only Abby is allowed to be the ""good girl"" and play with the dogs, while Ellie, the ""bad girl"", is only allowed to kill them.
the them is revenge is bad, but forgiveness, salvation and redemption are also themes. i was especially relieved when ellie let abby go
Like what?
You are totally fine with a game touting ""Revenge is bad"" with a little forgiveness, salvation and redemption sprinkled in when Abby, who killed Joel, is not killed by Ellie, while you omit EVERY-SINGLE-CHARACTER that was killed by Ellie on her way to Abby for revenge?
That is some next-level mental gymnastics.
i dont see killing a main character as a cheap plot device, i see it as emotional motivation to carry out a story about revenge
It always is a plot device to either end the current story arc or start a new one.
In this case I reckon the idea of having female main characters on killing sprees was set in stone, and the writers had to come up a story to fit.
Realistically speaking: what are the chances that the doctor who was killed at the end of TLoU1 had:
A child which
Survived until her teens in this unforgiving universe
Who then got saved by the very person who killed her parent and
Said person then completely breaking his previous character by going into a small room with unknown people + saying his same for Abby to make the connection?
And then that death is being used as the main driving force for Ellie to do something, which is the majority of the game, as far as I can tell.
If that is not cheap C- or D-movie story telling then I don't know what is.
i see that as an emotional journey, rather than manipulation. people were free to continue to hate her, but at least the game gave you the information to decide for yourself. i do see an argument for giving the player a choice whether or not kill abby at the end. however, letting abby live wasn't about abby, it was about ellie. if ellie had killed abby, she'd be lost emotionally forever. by sparing abby, it spared ellie.
How many hours does a player have to play Abby even if he either completely dislikes the character or doesn't want to be forced to play anyone else besides Joel and Ellie?
If it's not manipulation then how come e.g. every PR piece I've seen before release treads on eggshells to not reveal the fact that Joel dies quickly + the player then being forced to play as his killer?
Yet again with those next-level mental gymnastics: you are telling me that Ellie would've been lost emotionally only when she would've killed Abby, and not already due to the mountain of corpses she left behind on her way to Abby for revenge?
I might agree with you if Ellie found her way to Abby on a non-violent and diplomatic route, because then her not killing Abby makes at least sense to some degree, but as it stands her leaving a mountain of corpses behind to then not killing Joel's killer because ""Revenge is bad"" is utterly fucking stupid and insulting the player's intelligence.",0.6223541498184204

comments discussing characters of the game,"I'm glad that you liked the game, friend. I thoroughly disagree with you, but I respect (and even envy) your love for the game. What follows is my personal take, with no hate, but with the intention to explore and give a different perspective.
I think it's a good game overall, really polished. Great graphics, acting, sound. All good.
The gameplay evolved very little from the first game - as well as throughout the game itself. It's a long game; having such little variety was a real negative point, IMHO. Lack of enemy diversity was a bummer as well. Why not use more insane clickers? Maybe it's wishful thinking, but I think it would help a lot in the dynamics of the game.
The greatest sin regarding gameplay, however, is the dissonance between gameplay, story and themes. We see Ellie being emotionally destroyed by her experience during cutscenes, her pursuit for revenge - at the same time, we John Wick throughout the game, with no negative consequences gameplay-wise. Shit, it's fun as hell to brutally kill anything in the game. I think that the gameplay could have reflected better her struggle. Something like if you kill too many human enemies consecutively, Ellie's aim would get less reliable, her breathing would get louder, making it difficult to stealth, etc.
Regarding story, I think that Joel's death is the least of the problems. In fact, I don't consider it a problem at all - it was totally expected to happen. A Ned Stark level of shock would be to kill Ellie and have Joel go on a revange quest - which would not necessarily be good, but would be more shocking than Joel dying.
The storytelling is the biggest problem, IMO. I think it would be awesome, for example, to start playing as Abby, get to know her, get to love her (she's is a great character in the game!) and slowly discover that the person who killed her father was Joel. She kills Joel and the rest of the game we have this lingering dread: two characters that we love having to confront each other. Or even make Part II only about Abby, then a Part III about the clash between her and Ellie. I don't know, I'll not pretend that I have a better solution; I get that the game as is wants to convey a similar message. But I do believe that the writing team is not as good as they think they are.
The end is just sad, and I feel it is just for the sake of being sad, you know? Leaving Ellie in her worst nightmare (alone, all by herself) is, indeed, a bold decision. But I feel that, in contrast with the first game's message, it has little nuance, little payoff for a 25+ hour game, little to no catharsis.
All in all, I don't regret playing the game, nor think is a pile of flaming trash as some haters suggest. Likewise, I don't think it's a masterpiece, not by a long shot. I think it's a great case for not making sequels when not absolutely needed.
Again, no hate. I envy you for liking the game; I wish I was the same. As it is, I think it's a good game - and that's fine. Cheers! :)",0.6227298378944397
comments discussing characters of the game,"wonderful response. i loved your ideas about killing too many humans having game play effects on ellie, thats brilliant!
i thought about the playing as abby first part, but i think its much tougher to get players to like or accept a character they hate, than it is to get them to forgive someone they already like. and by the end, i found abby very likable and didnt want her to die, and to me that's a much greater achievement than just forgiving her, i came full circle from hating her and looking forward to killing her to liking her and wanting her to live, that to me was super impressive.
i actually liked that the gameplay wasnt much different. i just thought it was soooo much more refined and satisfying than the first game. i didnt need a ton of new mechanics and more controls and all these new systems. the weapons and upgrades were deeper and better and the combat more brutal, intense and engaging. i really just wanted more of The Last Of Us, not a jump from GTA4 to GTA5.
its not a feel good game, it dont think a happy ending makes sense. i was excited for ellie to get back to dina but when she got back to the empty house it felt like the right ending.
while the game didnt ""need"" a sequel, i certainly wanted one and didnt think it was a stretch to have one. Joel did some fucked up shit and there were bound to be consequences.

I think people who whined about Joel dying because ''they wanted to play with him more and felt like they missed out"" wern't able to allow themselves to reach the level of immersion the game creates.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Exactly it’s to show you that actions have consequences and mindless things you do affect other people and you can’t just kill a ton of people and it do nothing. Which you do in a ton of games and that’s fine but that’s not what they’re going for in this one. A lot of the complaints have nothing to back them up. And I think the creators know their characters more than anyone. I remember Troy talked about this on a podcast but I can’t remember exactly what he said. But it was along the lines of Joel “f*cked up.” And that happens especially to people in real life but people treat him as if he’s supposed to be the same person even years later but that’s not very realistic for anyone. And you want a game character to feel real.
And yes I didn’t like Abby either, I hated her and was so mad that they made me play her but towards the end I felt for her and didn’t want her to die. I was still upset over Joel but didn’t want her to die. And when I played it again months later I found myself not liking her again but at the end I was in the same boat of feeling for her. That’s just good story telling. And seeing the other side of the WLF felt very new and I’ve never seen a game let you play as the “villain.” Even though everyone is a villain and a hero in their own story.

comments discussing characters of the game,"2 years later and the game is still incredible .I still tear up when I even look at ending on youtube...
I will replay it on ps5 soon. Incredible gameplay, emotion, graphics and story.
When I see streamers going ""yeah kill her!!!"" at the end... I have no idea how they can still hate Abby. She suffered so much. She lost everything... the Owen arc... oh man.
they even show Ellie having a ptsd in a genius, frightening way. They both suffered
It just shows that people are stubborn and lack any empathy whatsoever. They get what they want or they get angry. It's not good what the internet (probably) is turning people into. This is an oscar worthy, classic tale told amazingly. Rollercoaster of emotions. I doubt there will ever be a better game. The only thing that comes close is Death Stranding.",0.6024548411369324

comments discussing characters of the game,"That is definitely true as well! They made a bold move by killing a character we love, and yet they managed to make it pay off heavily even if many can't recognize it. This game still blows my mind with how well written it is; the fact that NaughtyDog really managed to make people who truly paid attention (not that I mean to sound condescending to haters, but if you're involved with the story properly, you'll understand your parallels as a player to Ellie) do a full 180 from wanting Abby dead on sight to wishing she could just back out of the final fight is amazing.
I also read through a ton of replies and you only make good points. They didn't butcher Joel's character, they expanded on it. They showed us more of who Joel truly is when he can let the hardened shell around him wear down. He's still a threat in the apocalypse; anyone who played the game watched him rip through a Bloater with a machete. We just see him soften up a bit to people (due to being surrounded by them for the last 4 or 5 years) and accidentally slip. I honestly don't think it's out of character, especially when looking at the Sam & Henry bits from Part 1, and that's before Joel settled down.
I know I'm just repeating a lot of what you said lol, but anyway, absolutely fantastic analysis. I'm so glad to see the game getting appreciation that it deserves, and I'm happy to see reception of it has changed over the years (albeit many still blindly hate). Thank you!

comments discussing characters of the game,"Well from what I can tell the widely accepted argument seems to be that violence begets more violence. You spend the entire game murdering goons, which they did at least add something with the name mechanic, which I actually kind of like. I think it could be a little more deep but it's a cool concept. But so you go around murdering people the entire game in the most brutal of ways only to have a change of heart the moment you've got her head underwater? Idk. Just feels off to me. Feels very convenient. Also full disclosure Abby was a very hard character to connect with. She's selfish, unloyal, brutal, vindictive. Idk. It feels like she should've been the villain of this game. Sorry, total non sequitur with the last part honestly. Just spent years hearing hateful takes on this game.

comments discussing characters of the game,"The thousands of players writing long forums like these trying to explain why it’s a “good” game is testament to how bad the writing was and how it managed to divide half of its player base (mostly one side being loyal TLOU fans). You can’t fix bad writing. Any story can be told, whether Joel dies and we have to play as Abby right after (that really happened lol) and make it work, but since Neil himself was lead Dev, he managed to mess it all up with an already ballsy storyline. Point is, you can’t fix objectively bad writing my friend, no matter how much you disagree. From zero character development (especially for Abby which was crucial), to purposeful inconsistencies with characters (Tommy giving out their names when they met Abby not even 5 minutes after meeting formally). It’s garbage, corny, and ultimately leaves the player incomplete. Making us play as Abby right after she deleted Joel, really? Would’ve been a way better idea to start the game as Abby and then leading up to her deleting Joel. I’m no writer but even that was a better idea. We can go on and on about this.",0.6299378871917725

I almost wish they had gone in a different direction in story to focus completely on Ellie, though I know that would probably lose a lot of the angry emotions the game wants you to feel whenever you’re put in a polarizing situation with Abby.
I don’t think I care for Yara / Lev so much either, but they elevated Abby’s character to someone that you care for since you get to see her true self.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I know that this has been discussed many times before but I just want to give my take on it because I am late to the party.
Warning: this post will be very emotionally driven and not based on the writer's opinions or any official material, purely my opinion on the game and what I think of it.
I get it, killing Joel was necessary for this game because otherwise there would be no sequel that followed the cycle of revenge, and I was ""fine"" with that (I was really not, Joel is such a beloved character for me and many others and I loved him as if he was a real person, but since that was the driving motive for the plot then I can understand it, even if I'm not okay with it). But the execution was so poorly done that I feel like it was intentionally done, it felt as if the writers HATED Joel and wished to kill him, because getting brutally clubbed to death, spat on and ultimately treated like a dog instead of being given a proper death scene really makes you think that the writers hated him themselves.
You see, I already had it spoiled that Joel was going to die, I just didn't expect this dishonourable death, I heard things about a burning bloater that was stronger than any before it and I was expecting Joel to have this heroic death trying to save Ellie, maybe even wrestling with it before sacrificing himself so that Ellie could get to live. How wrong I was... Oh, the horror...
Joel didn't even put up a proper fight, I understand he's old but he's taken on stronger enemies than these little gang members before and it felt like he just gave up. Tommy also didn't do much and Ellie was just restrained by a literal Firefly NPC she could've easily overpowered even at 14 years old. This was all so disrespectful to the characters and it really downplayed their true strengths, this does not improve later in the game.
I just can't understand why Joel got killed so brutally by a fucking nobody (pardon me for my language), and how Ellie and Tommy also got a similar treatment. It was so dirty, it was not even proper writing, this is exactly the same as Batman getting killed in Gotham Knights.
And this doesn't improve. I have much more I want to address but let us fast forward to Ellie and Abby fighting in the theatre.
I will state the obvious. WHY DO WE HAVE TO CONTROL ABBY HERE? I was expecting the game to switch to Ellie, but Ellie folded hard and got reduced down to an NPC instead of the ruthless character that she is. Abby is not even that strong (besides being built she is not that impressive in terms of capabilities). Ellie is more experienced and not strong because the writers decided she had to be strong, which is the case for Abby. We see Ellie is very well versed in rifles and close quarters combat from an early age whereas Abby at the same age was getting babied by her father and has no feats of her own whatsoever. Abby is only strong because ""hell yeah buff woman!!111!!"" but she is a joke and this fight was a disgrace and the clear reason why one would agree that TLOU2 is not canon.
Were they just trying to establish a parallel between David VS Ellie and this? Because this is just not it. David was actually quite competent in that encounter and Ellie here is so shaky and scared, for what reason? She's faced stronger people and is far more skilled than Abby. She fought like how I fight in my dreams, I can never manage to get hits in when I fight someone in a dream and I feel as if I'm just grazing them, the same thing happens here. Wtf is this?
I literally could not get myself to press the square button to punch Ellie, I purposefully failed the QTEs (Quick Time Events) to get Ellie to kill this bitch, I was so happy that Ellie stabs her in the neck but disappointed when I was restarted to the last checkpoint. I found myself apologising out loud to Ellie because I DID NOT WANT TO HARM HER. So not only do we have to accept that this bitch kills Joel but we also HAVE TO play as her and kill Ellie? Absolutely not. Ellie was only spared because the writers could not kill her, it would be outrageous if it just ended there.
I was not aware the game did not end when Ellie was shown with Dina and JJ, I went on to rant to a friend about how shit the game is and how they butchered the expectations I had for the ending. Thankfully I was told that there was still another 2 hours of content. Although Abby was starved and weak, Ellie was also in a weakened state and was far more weakened than Abby was, because Abby could walk and carry Lev no problem and Ellie FELL trying to climb the small ledge on the way to the boats and could barely move.
You have no idea how much I enjoyed beating the shit out of Abby here. I was spamming the square button so hard and timing (almost) all of the dodging by pressing L1 every time, hell, I was spamming the square button even in the cutscene where Ellie drowns Abby, even though it was not required here, I almost broke my DualSense controller in this fight. Even if we were not given a proper fight on fair terms, I still enjoyed it, but ultimately expected Ellie to pull Abby out of the water which is what happened. It's not as simple as this, Abby bit off some of Ellie's fingers which meant that now she can't play guitar anymore and honour what she told Joel while he was still alive, to play the guitar. Not only that but Ellie gets back home to find Dina and JJ gone. She is left with no one. This is exactly what Ellie feared the most at the end of TLOU1. Her biggest fear has come true. While our beloved Ellie is left alone, unable to play the guitar, defaced, Abby got to escape with Lev and lead on a new, happy life. This is absolutely not right.
Not only that, I hated how long Abby's part of the game was and how dragged it felt, it was totally unnecessary because no amount of screen time could ever get anyone to like her after what she did. I especially hated having to go to the cultist island because this dumb little kid Lev felt like going to revisit his abusive mother who absolutely did not love him nor Yara. Not only that, but he gets bitchy when Yara dies, you think Abby wanted her to die? They were under no obligation to come all the way out here just because YOU felt like it instead of doing what the group was supposed to do with the stake at hand. At least he's the reason why Abby spared Dina, which is something, I guess.
I actually loved Ellie's part of the game. A friend told me he liked TLOU2 more than TLOU1 and I was about to agree if the whole game would be just hers, or at least the majority of it, not just half of it, and I expected her to be done right after what happened to Joel and how she was unable to help.
In Assassin's Creed III, when Connor Kenway leaves his village to go kill Charles Lee once and for all, he comes back and finds that everyone is gone and nobody is left, and this is exactly what happened with Ellie, but unlike Connor, she never killed Abby like how he killed Lee. Connor still had some of the people he met along the way of his journey. His mentor Achilles died, he had to kill his father, his mother died when he was 13 and had to see her burning alive because he could not pull her out, the man he trusted, George Washington, was the reason why his village was burnt. He had it rough, and ultimately his goal of revenge does not fill him entirely because he is also left with no one, just like Ellie. So I completely understand this ending, it is very similar to that of ACIII. But at least Connor is not fucked over and over and never truly recovers, Ellie is, and that's not what I was expecting when getting into TLOU2.
At no point did I ever feel connected to the Washington Liberation Front members, I hated Manny's guts after spitting on Joel, I hated Mel for her ""innocent"" character, Isaac was simply a prick, Nora deserved getting killed brutally by Ellie, Abby is, well, we know what she is and the only guy I actually liked from the bunch was Owen, who spared Ellie when she went to save Joel and when she infiltrated one of their facilities. It felt like an open-hand slap across the face to play as Joel's killer for as long, or longer, as we played Ellie and even having to play as her in their confrontation.
What even is the point of the shift? We loved Ellie and Joel so why did we have to focus on some stupid gang members who then focused on cultist kids with mommy issues? This is NOT how you give a ""different perspective"" to the conflict and Abby's father was in the wrong to begin with, how could you think of sacrificing a kid just for the sake of saving others? This was not even guaranteed to begin with. Nor did they have Ellie's consent but I guess consent and democracy were thrown out the window on Outbreak Day anyways.
I don't like how the last scene had to be a flashback of Ellie giving Joel shit for intervening when Seth was being blatantly homophobic, for telling Jessie things about her patrols and that she couldn't forgive him for not sacrificing her at the hospital (but she would try... eh). This does not make the situation of her biggest fear coming to life any better, but this could've possibly been the last interaction Joel and Ellie had, so I get it if that's the case. Really makes you think that you should've treated the person who cared for you the most better and not have been ungrateful, who knows when they will die, and if you're even going to be able to prevent it or just have to watch their death, helpessly...
There is a fine line between bold decisions in stories (like killing Joel) and just simply meatriding an absolute nobody like Abby and her group and giving them special treatment over the already beloved protagonists from the game before. The cycle of revenge them only really works IF the audience is equally attached to both sides and if both sides are given a fair treatment and not the bullshit fight at the theatre, where Ellie was done so dirty for no absolute reason at all. If you want equal attention to both sides Maybe don’t have the character we hate beat up the one we like? It’s not that hard to understand. Or—just maybe—give the character we hate some actual backstory before they kill someone we care about, so we can understand their motives before forming an opinion of them? First impressions DO matter, you know.
Anyways I took like 2 hours to type out all of this 😭 I really hope you guys can let me know what you think! Maybe I missed the whole point? I usually do, I'm sure that's the case here as well. I am open to having new insights on this but it hurt me so much that I don't really feel like debating it, it's just not going to make me like someone like Abby any more than I already do and I hate her with all my being as well as the writers who decided to take these turns.",0.626088559627533

This game is, from the writing point of view, terrible, without exaggeration. From the game design and direction points of view, it's flawed.
I think people praising it are either wanting to see the emperor's clothes or confusing the misery porn this game is with a ""deep/very impactful"" story.

I also would guess that if it wasn't for Fallout 76 and some other controversies then this probably would've been score a bit higher even if the general opinion was the same. What I mean by that is that we have seen before where a game from a big franchise/developer gets critical acclaim at launch only for opinions on it to quickly sour and suggest that maybe those initial scores weren't genuine and based more on hype or the size of the franchise. I'm thinking about games like Skyward Sword (93) or Red Dead Redemption 2 (96), where the talk about the game just doesn't line up with the scores.

Combat is just plain bad. I like it when a shooter game mixes up things and makes us have certain skills or abilities to use in battles. But the robots you're fighting are sponges and there's not really anything you can do about that. 1v1 fights are doable, as long as you time you dodges right but as soon as another robot joins the fight you're screwed if all you're using is your axe.
I'm sure there's people out there that'll love this game and that's great! It's not my game though. Overall the only good thing I can say about the game is that the graphics are nice. I hated the rest of the game. And I was really excited to try it out and scratch that Bioshock/ Fallout itch I had. But it didn't scratch my itch. It only made the spot that itched bigger!",0.6073629856109619

comments discussing characters of the game,"Been playing it for about two days straight recently, so far I really like it it's good though I fear it's probably not gonna last much longer on the open market.
Not only for the recent ""news"" of how the game supports Russia since it was funded by Russian companies (personally don't think that because it was funded by a Russian company that it means they out right support Russia but not gonna get political on here.) but also the fact that After going through the hospital and reaching the end of the underground base in act... 3? You go into another ""in your mind"" moment and it plays a section of ""The Alien"" from the Netflix movie Annihilation (round about 4:41 into the actual piece.) which the devs may or may not have brought the rights to the music, tried doing some digging but so far haven't found much.
I rather enjoy the music myself and would prefer they just buy the rights to that snippet than them replace it but they gotta do what they gotta do. (If they don't have the rights obvs).
There's also so minor bugs here and there (mostly graphical.) still but it has only recently come out so it's not the end of the world, and some features should be added in like map markers, a compass, save station/repair vendor markers, etc. but all in all I'd say it's pretty good main character can be funny at times with his catch phrase ""Crispy Critters!"" instead of yelling expletives most times, and there are a good few references in there as well to older games. Combat is alright if a little frustrating at times, mostly due to the small scopes and how robots doge a point blank shotgun blast at times. Anyway I'm gonna stop here otherwise it's gonna be a full on review of the game lol.

The story is paper thin, but they went all in with the shounen anime style of storytelling.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I’ve already had this conversation, so you’ll excuse me if I try and summarize my previous points:
I didn’t mean that’s the specific reason Ellie doesn’t kill her, nor is that the only time that trope applies. The trope is whenever the hero lets the villain live after having chewed through the bad guys minions, who didn’t get that mercy despite arguably being more deserving of it.
You say every kill not against Abby’s pals is self-defense; so she did kill people that weren’t Abby out of malice, right?

comments discussing characters of the game,"I think these are excellent points, and are strongly supported by the themes of Bungie's earliest games. If you really dig into the lore of Marathon you'll find some shockingly similar themes to what you're discussing here: the ""destiny"" of the player's character ""becoming legend"" by transcending the boundaries of the game universe since they are controlled by a godlike being (us).
It's a damn shame the campaign came across so flat because I really like the concepts they're trying to introduce and play around with and would love to see them introduced to a wider audience. Instead I feel most people are just going to to equate the Veil with a maguffin and tune out for good.",0.6120739579200745

comments discussing characters of the game,"As the most popular comment said, TWD games have their characters characterized by the player, whereas in TLOU, the player has no decision-making power over the characters; they are their own people. It works as a series because the games are like a movie. TWDG, on the other hand, works better as a game than TLOU itself simply because it allows the player to have decision-making power over its narrative. TWDG connects players so that each has a unique personal experience, while TLOU is an experience shared by everyone, in which it matters little what the player thinks or feels.
I don't see making it a series as possible simply because the soul of TWDG is to involve the player directly in its narrative and have decision-making power over the characters, both in personality, behavior, and relationships. It's not impossible, but it is very difficult to do and make it pleasing to the audience.",0.6202028393745422

comments discussing characters of the game,"because if ellie killed Abby before realizing her lesson it would make more narrative sense and be more interesting for Ellie’s development. Do you think the rumbling should have stopped earlier?
Your whole attitude about this is incredibly irritating. You’re in other comments claiming people missed the point of the show despite being incorrect about key information. You came here for a one way conversation, not a discussion, which is unfortunate as your theory is interesting and solid, but the fact you’re being a complete narc about it makes me not want to engage.
On that of that, you’re making definitive claims about things that are NOT definitive, or are open to interpretation. Neither Eren or Ellie are motivated by a “sole” factor. You are also arguing people in the comments have “fallen for the cycle of violence” again, while ignoring what perpetuated Eren and Ellie’s violence.
The world would be better off with their death - that’s true. But would you roll over and die? Would anybody? That’s what instigates them into action. By just blaming the cycle of violence, you’re essentially saying these characters should just get over it - the Zeke philosophy. Which as we’ve seen, only leads to more resentment and blind rage from characters like Eren and Ellie. The cycle of violence. To minimize any of that, is to write off the actual conflict of these stories - the human heart in conflict with itself. Dual motivations. Directly opposing motivations from the exact same character.
C’mon man.",0.6268114447593689
comments discussing characters of the game,"Ignoring that last paragraph, cuz that's just putting words in my mouth, how am I wrong about key information?
Yes, a discussion about Eren's motives could fill up a book. For the purposes of this post, which does not engage with Eren's motives whatsoever, a ""sole reason"" (being selfishness) is fine. We don't need to argue about Eren's motives.
Ellie IS motivated by a sole factor. She abandons her faction, kills everyone in her way, then literally abandons a perfect life THAT SHE EARNED just to go after Abby.
Also, I'm not sure what you mean with the first sentence because of the pronoun usage, as it could go both ways. Regardless, Abby is an important character to show that there are people out there who were hurt by Joel's actions, who despite that, are willing to forgive and move on.
This game isn't an Abby game. It's an Ellie game. The development that Ellie gets is her reaching her lowest point. Abby is there to show someone who has climbed over that point and moved on. In the end, Ellie successfully reaches that point, but at a cost that is far too great. Abby reaches that point earlier because she isn't the focus. Ellie is. Ellie's arc begins where Abby's ends.
Both characters pursued their revenge, suffered heavily because of it, and walked away because they stopped short of losing themselves. if Ellie kills Abby, the message that gives is that someone is eventually gonna get revenge on you, no matter what you do. By having both survive, you show that there can be redemption and forgiveness.",0.6194297075271606
comments discussing characters of the game,"Nobody says revenge is good for Abby.
I understand where your frustration comes from, but I think the game is trying to show Ellie's growth. This isn't about Abby getting revenge. She already got it.
The game is about how Ellie pursuing vengeance rottens her to the core.",0.6005264520645142
comments discussing characters of the game,"Abby literally spares Ellie 3 times over the course of the game, even when she had every right to kill her. She spares both Ellie and Dina ever after Ellie kills all her friends for seemingly no reason. She has constant nightmares about her dad's death, and only finds peace after choosing to save Lev and Yara. She began using her strength to pursue hatred and ended the story using it to protect someone else.
She was also hunting Joel, she didn't know he'd be the one saving her. It was pure coincidence. Him saving her doesn't cancel out the years of pent up anger and rage. If you can empathize with Gabi for shooting Sasha and then having a character arc after, you should be able to empathize with Abby for literally the same thing.
You don't need to like the character, the point is for you to understand them. Whether you like them or not is subjective. I like Abby. If you don't, then she just doesn't appeal to you, and that's fair.
The point about Eren is one I'm not gonna argue over. I stated very clearly that the meme simplifies Eren's motivations just so I can draw a parallel between him and Ellie.",0.6035211086273193

comments discussing characters of the game,The writing is great it’s just there’s a loud minority (many of whom have probably never picked up a novel beyond high school - let’s not forget majority of gamers are at the lower end of the IQ spectrum).

I’ve never had a video game elicit such strong emotions in me in the same way you describe. If there is a Part 3 I’m not sure they’ll be able to top Part 2.,0.6229676008224487
comments discussing characters of the game,"I agree with you that the writing has great parts and respect the game for taking risks, but I didn't enjoy the game or it's writing overall and I disagree that enjoyment of it has anything to do with IQ, it's more down to just general opinion/perspective.
With that, I also want to make it clear since this game is so divisive that I don't have anything against anyone that enjoys it.",0.6679551601409912
comments discussing characters of the game,"This is a common thing people who like this game say ""If you don't like Part 2 you're stupid or immature."" They think they're superior because they swallow everything without thinking. It's a pretentious echo chamber that berates the other sub because ""it's full of hate"" but that's just what they were told and didn't visit it to see.
Just like what they do in regards to Part 2. They see the game as well as the other sub as single units instead of things comprised of multiple parts. Part 2 is beloved by the majority of people, EXCEPT the story. The other sub is full of people who disagree about the direction of the story but couldn't speak freely here. There are people there who are fully intent on hating it, of course. It's not a single unit. There's nuance to everything. How can these people who are so ""smart"" with their high IQ's not see this? The same way they don't see any flaws in Part 2 when clearly there are a lot of them.",0.6018297076225281
comments discussing characters of the game,"It's the only game I can throw on the YouTube movie cut like it was a movie. Enough to say if it were a movie, it would be one of my favorite ones.
The only issues I have with the writing are the wild coincidences. But they're to drive the story forward. Also the insane amount of traveling they do. The first game showed how the road is treacherous, the whole thing was just that one way trip. In part 2 they're making multiple thousand-mile trips back and forth. Some stuff in the notebook about it, but the shit only seems to hit the fan in or around the destinations. Showing all that would make the game like 10 discs so I get it, just not plausible the trips go so smoothly only to get crazy in the last couple days.
But as far as actually writing choices - my gripe is with Tommy. After what happened to Joel, he's full of excuses on how finding Abbys group is a fool's errand. Him sneaking out is a way to get a headstart on Ellie to protect her, so she isn't the first one through the gate. Then in the theater before Abby shows up, he's willing to leave things the way they are just so they can start the trip back before the big storm hits. Completely fine with it. Then at the farm house, he guilt trips Ellie into going out all over again by herself to finish things, and throws a fit when Ellie and Dina say they're done with that mission. That was so out of character for Tommy, and even contradicts how they wrote him just a few hours of gameplay before that. Going from leaving Abby alive where Ellie is like ""the fuck are you talking about, she's the main dude we're here for"" to then have Tommy saying ""the fuck you mean you're done hunting down Abby, you forget about Joel or something"" seemed like a bit of a lazy move, sacrificing a legacy character's integrity to trigger the final chapter.",0.626873791217804

comments discussing characters of the game,"Idk about all the gender and political stuff you talked about.
But i can talk about what made me not like the story and It's basically the one thing that seems to dictate whether a player will like the story or not and that's their opinion of Abby.
Those who like her, like the story. Those who hate her, hate it.
Imo the concept and ideas that ND was going for are interesting. Trying to draw parallel between two characters and show you that they're not so different and trying to make the player care for both while they both wanna kill each other so you're always reluctant to play as either of them because you're scared that one of them will die.
The execution however is atrocious imo. The goobers at ND made the first action that abby does an extremely negative one. Joel dying is fine. The issue is that abby does it AS SOON AS WE MEET HER.
You INSTANTLY start to hate her and want revenge because even though Joel wasn't a good guy, he was still dear and close to the player. I don't care if joel was a bad person, he was important to me. I don't care if he killed abby's father. I killed those fireflies with a smile on my face because i wanted to save ellie who i cared about. I have a relationship with Ellie and Joel, not with abby.
It's easier to make someone hate a character than to make them like a character, and making someone like a character they hate is almost impossible. The writers overestimated their ability to make people like Abby. It worked for some ofc but for many they couldn't forgive Abby and why should they ? She killed joel as soon as they met her. Why forgive? Because revenge is bad? I don't care that it is. I still want it. It may not solve anything but i still want it. It may not bring back Joel but i still want it.
It's a goal and a purpose that the game basically tells me to go do then at the end takes it away making my entire journey meaningless. I don't care about a message about violence or whatever. I want revenge. At least in this case because joel was such a good character that abby has no chance of competing with.
Also keep in mind, it's a video game. People immerse themselves in it and they become the character they play. It's not Ellie getting revenge, it's ME.
In my opinion, they should have made a spin-off about abby, make us like her then at the end show us the hospital scene with her dad dying. To tie it all together. Then in tlou part 2, the story could have basically gone on as it did (with slight variations and improvements).
OR
They could have just given the players the choice of Killing abby or not, then debates would actually be better. About which choice is more appropriate and why.",0.6123267412185669
comments discussing characters of the game,"I’ll have to admit for a game of which I believe has fairly good main character writing and great game design and how the themes tie into that, the game specifically for Ellie Day 3, and a lot of Rattler epilogue has dog crap plotting at times.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Hmmmm, see the problem is I don't like the fact that it's so easily missable as you say.

Perhaps he watches someone dressing a wound and calls out the improper use of chest bandages (""Not too tight around the chest now, it crushes the lungs. Trust me, I've made that mistake far too many times when binding. Thank goodness for proper binders these days.""), or he mentions being forced to wear a dress when he was younger and absolutely hating it (""Why would you be forced to wear a dress as a man?"" ""Well I didn't know that at the time.""), or he receives a letter from his parents, takes one look and immediately chucks it into a fire because it's got his deadname on it (you don't see the deadname ofc), or hell, if you take his armor off he has top surgery scars.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Only played it the first time this year and thought it was an incredible experience. Wildly ambitious in terms of storytelling, though sometimes a little too ambitious for its own good.
That said the Abby twist worked exactly as it was intended for me. At first I was like “no, fuck these guys, I don’t wanna play as them”. But by the end I realized I just wanted Abby and the kids to just get away from everything. That’s when I remembered that the Ellie story ended with Abby coming back for her. Playing through that confrontation as Abby was genuinely one of the coolest things I’ve ever played in a game. It’s so fun fighting your own player character using all of the gear and abilities you collected.
It’s definitely not perfect, and like I said there were times when ambition got in the way of telling just a nice clean story, but at the end of the day I’d still consider it one of the best story driven games of all time.",0.6120574474334717

The fact that people initially thought she was trans permanentely poisoned how people looked at her).
I thought the ending was perfect. Ellie losing the fingers she needed to play guitar was genius.

But that's where it stops for me. Once the story beats are all known, the game really starts to show that it's pretty...well, average is harsh, it's above that, but I just never found it doing anything that seemed particularly revolutionary.

None of it is treated seriously enough I feel. Like each region needed so much more deep diving.

comments discussing characters of the game,"It... probably won't happen, but I really hope this whole thing is either retconned somehow or some other, more complete media about the Ruination and the Sentinels is released, because all of your points are spot-on. I don't know how they thought this was going to be a good idea. It makes both the Sentinels AND Viego look stupid, when both have a lot of potential. Vex is a nice addition, though, I wonder what she'll be like in-game.
The world, as you say, receives 0 development, and basically no characters other than the Sentinels, the Ruined characters, Viego and Vex show up. It has so much potential, yet the event is clearly just meant for marketing skins. Perhaps they know most people don't read the lore? But there's writers at Riot that are passionate about their work, and they've shown us that they are absolutely able to make a very interesting world with a variety of creatures, factions, and other individuals. To reduce the scope of the event so much seems like a very, very unintuitive move, even from a marketing standpoint. If you manage to get people to read lore, more interest in it may also mean they're able to sell more books about Runeterra and stuff like that. I read Realms of Runeterra and it was pretty damn good, honestly. The worldbuilding was good, the stories at the end of each section were great... But even then, the game's lore is barely advertised, even, which again, is weird considering its huge potential. It's so weird that the biggest event of their biggest product has been cartoonized to such a point. I feel bad for the characters, honestly. So... yeah, here's hoping player feedback does something.
Unbound Thresh
Ugh, this skin is...
-Ugly (like, it's awful ingame)
-Ridiculous in the fact that it is his default skin in WR. Come on, even if it's because of age-rating or whatever, there's ways to make him look more human without just outright remodeling his face and changing his skin color. And... yeah, they could have only made that his default skin where necessary, like they did with Smite's Hades.
-I'm not the type of person to be like ""ugh League is only anime boys now"" (and I'll admit, with time I've come to actually like Viego's design, with my biggest complaint being that Riot just gives him a different face in every single different media)...

comments discussing characters of the game,"This is probably the most constructive and accurate feedback posted about the event yet. It's clear a lot of people making criticisms don't actually follow the lore and as a result often claim certain things that just flat out aren't true.
I agree with a lot of what you're saying here, particularly about the rookie and VN format. It really feels like the rookie was their attempt at getting non-lore fans to feel excited and connected to the story as it progressed but it really fails to do so in my experience. People who aren't interested in the lore aren't going to suddenly care if they get to make the occasional quip and people who ARE interested in the lore don't really care about a self-insert and just want to experience the characters and world.
The Marvel inspirations are VERY obvious with how the characters are handled as well. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it leaves some interactions feeling very cookie-cutter and cheesy at times (particularly with Olaf). The actual encounters with Viego feel very ham-fisted as well, every location feels more or less the same: Meet new sentinel, fight mist wraiths, encounter the fetter, Viego shows up, throws a Ruined champ at the group, leaves with fetter.
The lack of a central narrative team handling the event is also very evident. It feels like every team working on this had their own vision for the plot and didn't really communicate with the rest of the teams on a more cohesive plan.",0.6370614767074585

comments discussing characters of the game,"I really appreciate the write up but I’m not surprised by Riot doing this. I used to, like you, love the lore. It was what brought me into the game primarily. But after a while Riot just started erasing and rewriting solid characters and plots at worst or just making them “alt timelines” at best.
This, from the sound of it, is kind of the worst of both. It’s not rewriting the timeline or making it an alternate one but also trying to shoehorn in things just to shoehorn them in. It’s just lazy and it makes me sad at what they are doing to the lore.",0.6242486834526062
comments discussing characters of the game,"I would like to preface this by saying that I am really in awe of your effort to describe your points of which you brought forth a remarkable amount! Around 7k words, around 39k characters! Took me a while to read. Then again, I'm almost never on reddit, so idk if it's a common thing to write large paragraphs of text here when discussing stuff.
You seem to be knowledgeable in literature, its study, its tropes & very much attentive to details which I find very commendable (especially for a league player /sarcasm).
So I read your whole essay & all your arguments & points of criticism became very apparent to me almost immediately.
However I was left with that weird feeling of ""Well, somehow, I just don't care, I just like the story & the event (even though I admit the VN format is rather crusty, but at least better than in spirit blossom)"". My willing suspension of disbelief was not shattered, which is also the reason why after reading all of that I will probably still enjoy the event. (The only point that really hit a nerve was ""Why is Gwen alive, but not the other objects?"" but my gf suggested ""Maybe cuz she was made by Isolde herself"" & I was satisfied :P)
Now I am really curious why that is & what might be your opinion on that.
(Also, what is ""IP""? I had very much trouble with all your abbreviations, ""SI"" is ""Shadow Isles"", I guess?)",0.6111823320388794
comments discussing characters of the game,"My problem with the event and League’s story in general is that there’s no characters besides the champions we play as, it’s so unbelievable and frankly goofy. They say they’re inspired by Marvel for this event and it clearly shows. League’s overuse of its legendary-in-universe champions, who are heroes and leaders and sometimes literal gods, who all just so happen to be the only characters who ever do anything in the story is ridiculously.
The best example I can think of, of a world that uses many different characters well to flesh out its believable world, would be Avatar the Last Airbender. Ignoring the main characters, there are tons of supporting characters and 1-off world building characters, it makes the world much more believable. Imagine if avatar only had its main cast, and none of its supporting characters, and the roles those side characters played were instead forced into the main cast, it would be ridiculous. Imagine if the only earth kingdom character who did anything was Toph. It would be silly. Same thing with League
League needs more side characters and unique non-champion characters who play roles in these stories, otherwise it’s just silly and starts to feel like the Avengers, at least to me.",0.6134435534477234

For what it's worth, I think this event's been pretty good for people like me who I assume is their target demographic, where I'm not suuuuper into the lore and have a very short ADHD attention span; and the twitter-sized text bubbles are let me consume the story in a format that holds that attention.
Don't get me wrong, it comes at a LOT of cost; basically everything you outlined in your post. Characters are not done justice; the worldbuilding is not done justice. But it's served as a good way to convey ""hey here are the gists of these characters, if you're totally unfamiliar with their backstory"".
Maybe some supplemental lore, like on the website or something, for the really enfranchised lore fans would be good. But what they've implemented in-game I think works well for the goal they set for it.",0.6154909133911133

I loved the prequel novel and everything Insomniac have revealed so far about their Spider-Man so it's great to hear the story is anywhere from genuinely entertaining to outright fantastic. I'm already invested in their version of these characters and I can't wait to play through the story.
Reviews don't mean much to me beyond giving an indication of just how solid a game is e.g I didn't think God of War was a masterpiece but I knew it would be a good game, so I was just hoping these reviews would back up everything shown from the game so far as being fantastic and I'm glad to see that's the case with what is undoubtedly the game I've been most hyped for ever.",0.6098588109016418

its much harder as much as you can try. make a very concrete and consistent game out of that because Spiderman is very fast as he should be and to make it work in a game you do have to add a few QTEs and such because you can't really react that fast otherwise it becomes a trial and error fest like super meat boy or something",0.6060076355934143

The swinging, combat, and New York City itself come together to create a Spider-Man experience that is exciting and faithful to the character.

Lots of top-scores because this is the review industry.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I hope you understand my meaning. I don't say spiderman looks bad, I am just saying, it's 7~8/10 game, which is fine, even great, but it's not a game that deserve that much hype.
This might be a simple phrasing issue but one should be careful about making such absolute statements when dealing entirely with their own opinion. I mean, it may only look like a 7~8/10 game to you personally but that means nothing to anyone else. As such, saying that the game that ""deserves"" that much hype makes it sound like you are not just saying that the game is not as good as some make it out to be but also that your opinion is somehow more important than that of others.
It is kinda like when someone says something is ""overrated"". If you have hung around this subreddit enough, you have probably heard more than a few people say that such and such popular game is ""overrated"" but all they are really saying with such a statement is that those who did really like said game don't like it as much as they think they do. That their opinion must somehow be poorly thought out.
You list some games that you think are ""perfect"" and that is great. Heck, I love some of those games myself but everyone is going to have a different list and for different reasons. No one person's list is more correct than another because opinions are not meant to account for everyone, just the person who holds said opinion.
This is where I actually value (at least some) professional game reviews (and not the stuff you find from gaming youtube pundits and the like). In some of the better game journalism outfits, there is a certain expectation to take a step back from one's own opinions and look at a game from a wider angle. To understand that sometimes a game is pretty good and that some will value it and some won't.
Look, there was a time when I overestimated the value of my opinions in a pretty big way. I remember lecturing people for listening to pop acts like The Backstreet Boys or similar. I would go on and on about how they should listen to ""real"" music and that there is no good reason for modern pop acts to be popular. After a time, I found that it is not nearly as simple. It may baffle me that someone would want to go see a Miley Cyrus concert but those that enthusiastically do so are justified in their decision simply because they enjoy it. It is not my place to judge their taste and nor it is my place to judge the pop star for being a good pop star. I understand that I am not the intended audience and that my opinion in such matters means nothing as a result.",0.6193970441818237
comments discussing characters of the game,"I think this game will be placed at least 8/10, pretty overhyped game with good graphics for the new consoles, but more than that remove that overhype glasses and you will see the flaws of the game.
I say this game: Feels like Spiderman , Open world can be a double edge sword if you have nothing to do than swinging around for ages. Side missions are important.
For example of bad Open world experience: Metal gear, Final Fantasy XV, GTA, Watch dog, sleeping dog
Good open world : Nier automata, Zelda breath, Mario odyssey, Skyrim, Yakuza 0

comments discussing characters of the game,"Not OP. Though these are my thoughts about D-game.
Possibility of tactical squad battles using Sigils to a great extent. If you played any battle-royale games then you'll get more attracted to it.
Variety of Sigils which can create impressive combos. THIS IS REALLY THE BEST PART OF THE SHOW.
Tensions that are brought in the game since it's a death game after all and you'll get no second chances.
Main character's determination and struggle for survival (especially in the first episode) and his VA is good. Not surprising as its Natsuki Subaru and Senku Ishigami's VA. Hoping he gets smarter than he is now. At first his sigil may appear OP but has some limitations which entirely depend on his tactical skills and intelligence.
VA of other characters are okayish but not something to write home about. Though the villains are not cookie-cutter like you'd expect and has different motivations for their actions.
Story's average for now but i'm hoping it improves later on.

So yeah, it's not the critiques or analyses of Sanderson's work that are the problem. Its the drive by insults that people seem to be into nowadays.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Great analysis! This summarizes most of what I've picked up on, plus some other tidbits I didn't catch. One thing I'll point out is that your TL;DR comment about leveling is likely on the right track - all the footage is from playtests before they started recording for the stream, so they are most likely higher than the levels shown. My guess is they'll start around level 5 to make sure some of the cooler class features unlock on-stream (level 6).
I'd also point out that the backgrounds on the campaign screen could provide some clues to what classes are present. To me it looks like the bottom row includes a ranger (edit: actually probably warlock), a fighter of the Air Ashari, and maybe a monk, though it's super hard to tell. However, if Aimee's a warlock, Robbie's a bard (middle top), and Ashley's a druid (top right), it makes sense that Matt and Liam are more likely to play martial or half-caster classes.
I agree that Liam may be the Air Ashari character after his insta takeover. With the metallic/rainbow dice Aabria picked for his character, if he's a fighter maybe a psi warrior or arcane archer? I think Matt could be the ranger, I'd love to see an urban-flavored gloomstalker affiliated with the Clasp. To your point about world building, if he's with the Clasp it gives a canonical reason for Matt to be intimately familiar with Emon and the city's history.
EDIT: Looking on a bigger screen, the bottom right definitely looks more like warlock than ranger, and looks like the character name is ""Opal"" - which fits Aimee's dice sets, so to me supports the other evidence she's playing a warlock. So that leaves probably the monk for Matt. The subclass has a long name, so I'm going to go on a limb and guess he's playing the UA ascendant dragon monk. It fits within the backdrop of a post-Thordak Emon, and it's super different from the Cobalt Soul monk we saw with Beau.
EDIT 2: Aimee mentioned on her insta Q&A that her initial play test character was different than the character she settled on for EXU. She initially played a version of the character she was going to guest as in C2, and changed it to fit better with the story and the group. Her character sheet in the video might be that old character, so that makes her a bit more of a wildcard!",0.6005427837371826

comments discussing characters of the game,"In my opinion the problem is that it relies heavily on text to show the story. This is a game which is able to have interactive form, they should have incorporate game element instead of showing all texts to the audience.
The sense of progression that would be fulfilling as a reader, is nonexistent because HG isn’t exactly trying to follow a tangible storyline anymore.
That's what I think too. The main story is pretty slow paced, it took 2 years and 8 chapters to finish the reunion story and Victoria story was started in 2022 with no end in sight yet. The events story are just 'character of the month' type of story. Side story is good addition for main story, but if they keep making side stories, the main story will stagnate.
In the other side, I like the Arknights anime. It showed some things I missed before, here's a comment from someone which I agree:
It took me watching the second season of Arknights anime adaptation (Perish in Frost) I learned why fans fond of her that they wished FrostNova had happier ending. Her interaction with Doctor when they stuck in that rubble and the final confrontation said it all.

—
In the end, is AK’s writing really that bad?
Well, despite my criticisms, I find it hard to call it a truly awful reading experience. Certain parts I definitely find it to be, but the quality tends to vary depending on the kind of storytelling it has. It can be anywhere from alright to genuinely satisfying and thought-provoking when it focuses on the characters and fleshes them out. It’s more than decent when it doesn’t drag its feet around in a misguided attempt to look more profound than it actually is.
Almost each storyline no matter how good, however, is liable to nearly everything I addressed in this essay. The less than stellar parts of the story suffer the most from these problems on a regular basis. To this day, they haven’t really changed, and even gotten worse to some extent. What has surprisingly improved over the years is what the community allegedly complains about the most; the content to word count ratio. Nevertheless, that is far from enough to fix the flaws within the storytelling.
I think to sum it all up, the part that needs the most improvement is the ability to let the characters and the world flow naturally, without forcing them to demonstrate an ideology the writer approves or disapproves of. Not all good guys have to be saints and heroes completely justified in their actions, not all bad guys have to be villains condemned to either redemption through death or have their moral failings minimized to make their actions seem better to justify their upcoming addition as playable operators. Not every part of the worldbuilding has to be totally depressing and bleak, but not all the nicer parts have to be sunshine and roses either. Take a braver approach, but make that moment actually count for the rest of the narrative rather than leaving them as a pure shock factor to reinforce a specific part of the storytelling. Last but not least, a bit more humor and wit does wonders to make our time with the characters feel more precious.
PS: I enjoyed reading Hortus De Escapismo. Executor is the best.",0.6107153296470642
comments discussing characters of the game,"This is a well-thought out criticism, but there's a couple of points I disagree with.
With respect to ""Character Writing"" and ""No True Dystopia"", I think that's largely the *point* of the writing. If I were to summarize the writing for this game in one sentence, it would be ""characters as representations of ideals struggling to come to terms with injustices passed down from their forebears"". It's a stylistic choice, and a lot of the more philosophically interesting stories come from leaning heavily into this. For instance, I think HE is the best story we've gotten in a while, and the characters are basically nonexistent as characters: Executor is a viewpoint character who takes everything at face value, Arturia is so transparently a representation of the concept of ""freedom"", Clement is representative of giving up hope, the Sarkaz mercenary in unimportant outside of the concept of redemption from age-old wrongs. It's not a fun romp, but then again neither is, say, Lord of the Rings. (Not that AK story is as high-quality as that - but they both take similar symbolic approaches to storytelling, and fundamentally making the storytelling less symbolic fundamentally changes it, it doesn't just improve it.) And at least in the last few events (I'm thinking HE and chapter 12 here), they are willing to have non-idealistic characters suffer tragic events through no fault of their own and then be punished for them.
With respect to ""Morality Armor"" and ""Tell Not Show"", I think you're underestimating the reading comprehension of the average reader (or at least, what HG expects the average reader to understand; I definitely think there's a lot of misreading in general, especially around everything involving the Seaborn). These seem to me like clear, intentional juxtapositions: why are we claiming to fight against injustice when we do nothing in the gameplay except fight against Reunion, who have completely justified grievances? Why do we rescue Popukar and Rosmontis from human experimentation, and then send them out to fight? (Rosmontis even has a line, if you assign her to a factory, about how it reminds her of the trauma of the lab she was in and how she doesn't want to be there.) Certainly every viewpoint character in events (maybe not Fiammetta, maybe not Executor also) is an unambiguous force for good in terms of how they present themselves, and yet Rhodes Island collectively perpetuates tremendous harms, which you could uncharitably interpret as the writing being disjointed and unsure, but I more interpret as ""we shouldn't take everything that Rhodes operators say as fact"". (And in fact, there are definitely some references to this - Ho'ol's file talks about how Rhodes is definitely not a small player on the international scale, as it has long made itself out to be, and it's very textually clear that it is essentially a Kazdel splinter faction akin to the Kazdel Military Commission too; there are *current* heads of state that are employees, and so on). I think you're taking the writing too much at face value when we *know* many of the people speaking are biased in one way or another (I would point to Gladiia and Kal as the two most specific examples), and in doing so are missing out on many of the more interesting aspects of the storytelling.
With respect to ""Structural Problems"", I think the existence of greater threats makes little difference as to the significance of smaller threats and this is a point that the narrative makes repeatedly. We still agitate against animal cruelty and poverty in the real world instead of focusing all our efforts on nuclear disarmament and genocide and global warming. But I agree that the writing in the Victoria chapters has been a little bit disjointed and poorly paced.
And of course, I totally agree about the lack of stakes. But I think overall you're doing the writing an injustice by approaching it too literally and being too trusting of in-universe speech and text.",0.6203145980834961
comments discussing characters of the game,"Thank you for your thoughtful comment. This topic is what I’m trying to address the most, because the bizarre stylistic choice that AK conforms to, is probably one of the core issues within the storytelling.
In normal writing, it’s completely normal to second guess a character’s thoughts. It’s not impossible for AK, but the writing, at least to me, just makes it difficult to do so. Take Kal’tsit for example, she’s meant to be the epitome of moral ambiguity despite her genuine desire to do good. But every time she does something supposedly morally dubious, the game always goes out of its way to prove her to be the unquestionable force of good, and that she always ends up being in the right, all that stuff I’ve talked in more length in the essay.
The biggest part of this is that she never suffers from any consequences that you would expect from a character who constantly keeps secrets to herself and manipulates others to be the smokescreen to her true intentions. That defeats the purpose of having a morally ambiguous character. This is in stark contrast with Executor, who’s similarly driven to do what’s right and is completely mechanical in his thoughts and actions, until he started to doubt himself at the end of HE. He had a development that Kal’tsit never had (on screen, it’s only told at best), and the story never tries to defend of justify his actions, and even his colleagues are sometimes put off by his lack of emotional tact despite acknowledging his efficiency. While I wouldn’t call Executor morally complex, the story gives him depth by juxtaposing his character with others who don’t share his view, which leads him to question if his action is right if it fails its objective, no matter how perfectly he executed it (no pun intended).
Kal’tsit on the other hand, is completely surrounded by people who are unyieldingly loyal to her, doesn’t question her one bit, and the few dissents she has come from her enemies. Exhibit A is when Amiya witnessed the genocide of Sarkaz in the past, but instead of being less sure of her mentor figure, she practically came to her defense that Kal’tsit is ultimately trying her best. There’s no point to questioning her actions at all if the story will never follow up on it or respect the opposing take on her personality and villainizes that viewpoint. The story seems to force its readers to take certain things at face value, meaning it’s pointless to interpret them ambiguously when either you’re never really meant to or the story winds up backtracking on it and never tries to hold on to that for long or consistently.",0.6059467792510986
comments discussing characters of the game,"I agree. I’m not expecting AK to be another GFL, both do have their own takes on idealism, and it’s fine if RI is more on the hopeful and revolutionary side of things. It does get a bit off-putting however when the writing refuses to “punish” the characters accordingly for their reckless course of actions or keep them grounded to the rules of the worldbuilding, which is pretty much the case with MCs of AK.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Alright, I'm gonna try and not repeat discussions that others have already commented on. Here we go anyway.
Character Writing
I agree overall, while AK has many interesting in concept characters we either do not get enough time with or finish their arc and just kind of sit around. I honestly feel this is a trap with the gacha format. We get new shiny characters that get nothing because the gacha needs new fodder. And characters that have been around for awhile due to fan attention get dragged through stories that don't need them.
Morality armor
While I agree with the point I have never really been bothered by this personally. Its not great writing mind you to dismiss any negative thing the MC faction does cause 'they mean well' but I see that so often in fiction I just roll my eyes and move on.
Tell not show
Agreed, but you kind of repeat some of your previous points here.
No true dystopia
I feel you should have broken this section down into 2 different sections for the gripes you mentioned. For the first one, no AK is not a true dystopia. At best it is a slightly dower setting with societal issues mirroring modern day issues. Poorly.
Your second point in this section being the Idealist/Moralists that pop up constantly in the stories. I agree that if the setting was a true dystopia it would be weird or grating. But since it isn't I find it endearing half the time.
AK focuses more on the emotional notes of stories a good deal of the time. Less on the rational and more of the spirit of the matter. This really causes the readers mileage to vary in my experience, and can be fine or annoying.
Lack of stakes
I mean, your right. But I don't see this as something particular to AK. I saw you mention Final lesson in another comment and while I do applaud the devs killing the character. That was kind of it. They died in the story and we moved on. FGO did its own version of this. But they are still playable. I would really only care about this if they deleted the character from the roster. Which while really cool conceptually would piss off many people.
Structural problems
Ah, the writing issue that I can not forgive personally. This is AK's greatest fault and I see little they can do to fix this at this point. I will openly admit that I loathe reading the Main Story, it has never been good in my opinion. Fine with good moments but overall just an interesting setting.
Now the side stories? That the real shit. Mostly self contained and thematic with focused characters and sometimes we even just have fun adventures! These are why I come back to AK, expanding on the setting and characters in shorter (compared to the multi-part main story arcs) stories.
Overall I agree with your points. AK is no magnum opus but I find the most consistently decently written mobile game out there. Hell sometimes the writing genuinely blows me away (Break the Ice, Lonetrail).
I would ask you what other AK stories you greatly enjoyed? I saw you mentioned enjoying Hortus De Escapismo, what other stories had less of these issues in your eye?",0.6044237017631531

comments discussing characters of the game,"This was an interesting post to read. Thank you for the deep analysis! That's what real discussion looks like, thumbs up.
Allow me to address a few points, some agreeing, some ""I don't really mind it and don't think it's a flaw"":
It's strange to bring up ""Lowlight's writing style"" when it's clear this all isn't written by one person but by a crew of writers. I could speak about it with more confidence if I read Chinese, but even without the original text it doesn't take two guesses to assume the Laterano writer and Leithanien writer have distinctly different styles and approaches if you read ""Lingering Echoes"" after ""Guide Ahead"". I wish AK would publish its writers like it does its artists... Though I also understand why it doesn't do it with how quick the Chinese fanbase is to harass creators when someone doesn't like some plot development.
The characters I'd agree that AK characters are heavily defined by the ideas they represent, but I don't think it's a bad thing. They still end up vivid and memorable, and the relationships between them matter. If anything, I appreciate AK keeps their characters more focused and level-headed compared to usual ""anime"" writing with overexaggerated tropes, they feel pretty human. You usually don't see all persons' traits from one dialogue you've had on a job. They just don't go off to display traits that would be irrelevant to the situations the characters appear in, and AK keeps most of its events relevant and serious. (This is written by a person with FGO trauma of characters pulling random gags in serious plots)
About RI's position, I would agree, they're pretty much the moral beacons of the story, and nowadays there is even less gray left than there was initially, especially concerning Doctor. I miss the times we were supposed to be guessing about the Doctor, now I can't imagine them doing anything bad. They're just Saint Jesus. I'd say RI is the moral compass and the conveyor of the ""no sacrifices are necessary"" and ""lives are important"" messages the game wants to tell to its audience. (Kal gets good characterization about her past mistakes and the reasons for that, though. Her previous ""let's just genocide the problem guys"" answers to problems certainly weren't great. And that comparison to her current self is what makes her my favorite AK character) And to the next point...
Hence for someone who’s at the forefront of RI’s main fighting force, rarely killing anybody at all, is nigh unrealistic
They're a pharmaceutical company. It's questionable they have a private army, here I sure agree, but saving people FROM getting killed instead of killing is their whole point. If they were killing, they'd be going against their own message and goal.
I agree RI themselves are in no way struggling. Which is the case with real NGO's, I'd say. Let's take a random example: UNHCR employees definitely aren't struggling, the organization will take care its employees are alive and fed. Refugees they claim to be helping are for ones struggling. Replace with any other NGO.
I agree it's lacking that only NPCs can suffer death, and while I like the way some NPCs deaths are written, they could add some risks to the playables as well. That said, I believe there are many NPCs who have more importance and weight than many of the playable cast. Inside of the story, there exists no ""NPC"" and ""playable"" division. And that's a good thing, limiting the story to highlight only playables usually harms it. But we know who has the plot armor for the meta reason of us playing the game.
I don't really mind there being ""no hero to follow"", I enjoy ensemble cast stories. At this point I perceive Arknights to be not a single story of Rhodes Island, but a collection of stories about Terra. And finally...
While the story does depict a world marred by disasters and tragedy, the situation is never far from hopeless
And that's Arknights' whole point
Arknights isn't hopeless, but I'd like to think that neither is our world. There are shit people, and there are people who genuinely want to help. The difficult part is to give the right people the right power.
I think the merit AK has to it as a story is to be this fantasy homage to problems that trouble the writers in real world, point them out, and make the player, who is definitely one of the privileged to be playing this from a smartphone in their comfy bed, to think about some stuff that happens around them twice before they neglect it as someone else's problem. AK definitely doesn't provide answers. But I appreciate what it tries in creating a fantasy story around the grim core of our own world while still doing ""entertainment"".
P. S. Comparing AK to AAA action games that's happening in the comments is quite crazy. Please understand differences between genres and the production they go through. That said, AK definitely is a visual novel in everything related to its story. So the fair comparisons would be other visual novels and other gachas who use that format of storytelling. As someone who's always loved visual novels, I'm happy mobile games like this are allowing the unpopular genre to survive. Though that said, AK is definitely lacking in experimenting with its presentation, and any tying between gameplay and story is non-existent. They did it with Faust and Frostnova and never again.",0.6554098725318909

comments discussing characters of the game,"you’re just proving my point about the quality of the storytelling.
It tells an interesting story set in an interesting world.
I tend to see most criticisms of ""bloated"" to be coming from people who don't appreciate the details they skipped over. They don't understand the story.
Take the last 2 main chapters, 11 and 12. It deals with getting conquered and partially assimilated by a foreign country (Gaul and Victoria), as well as the desire to recover a national identity even after centuries of (failed) assimilation (Dublinn vs Victoria). There is the conflict between nobles, commoners, and king. Collaboration or resistance against foreign (Sarkaz) occupiers. Doing your duty or putting survival first. Idealism versus realpolitik.
These are serious issues that humanity struggles with, in a video game. I rate AK storytelling very highly because I appreciate how it captures elements of real human conflict and moral dilemmas. The ""bloated"" sections serve a purpose that isn't being recognized.
That the story doesn't let very bad things happen to the main characters or RI detracts from the story a little, but is forgivable. It's trading realism for escapism. We want heroes, and we want them to survive and win.",0.611251175403595

comments discussing characters of the game,"In true Naughty Dog fashion, the game has these small bits of dialogue (and some notes and letters) that act as minor opportunities for simple storytelling to keep the narrative work interesting, but they can often be so revelatory and speak volumes about the characters through fairly brief interactions that I would say they are probably some of the most interesting narrative stuff in the game.
I've seen so many YouTubers and streamers treat these moments as entirely passable, but It's precisely why I think some of these characters seem less fleshed out to them, because at least to me, these are the opportunities utilised by Naughty Dog for completely natural and considerably relevant character building.
For example the myth of Isaac - the leader of the WLF - and who he is are largely constructed through letters and notes littered throughout the game. I remember my first playthrough and his appearance felt so sudden because I had not taken the time to invest myself in the environmental storytelling, but then I did and he quickly became a much more nuanced and threatening character in my view.
The notes chronicle the story of a man who's deeply mired in the cycle of violence and it blinds him to pragmatism. To a lot of people their are a lot of questions about who Isaac is and why he would ever permit Abby and her crew to seek out Joel and kill him, because no responsible leader would do such a thing. But personally, I think that's what these letters expose - Isaac is an irresponsible leader.
Theirs's a letter about him killing a FEDRA soldier and the first time we see him we open to a scene of him carrying out torture. He has this need to protect his people through retaliation, and so he precisely understands Abby and her crew's need for revenge.
However, to me one of the characters that gets the best of it is Dina. We get great dialogue in cutscenes as well as some mandatory stuff in gameplay too that give us an impression of who Dina is. She's a loyal and determined companion who somehow has this great resiliency to her that she uses to triumph over significant hardship, where Ellie, Abby and Tommy seem much more susceptible to their worst impulses - but I think It's fair to say It's not entirely clear why she's this way.
So I found things exciting, when theirs's a incredibly brief yet significant story told about her that I think speaks volumes about who Dina is/was through those interactions and I think It does marvellous work to build the dimensions of her character.
For one, the game chronicles a brief story about her older sister - that some people might not even know existed after playing through the game - and just how much of an impact she had on Dina because it's largely gleaned through a series of these subtle interactions. Her name was Talia, and while the details about their past are brief the way Dina describes their relationship conveys a deep love and devotion to her.
The backstory goes that she was Dina's older sister and they deeply cared for one another. They lived in New Mexico for a time before their mother passed. She was an especially religious person always encouraging her younger sister to go to the synagogue to pray with her and through this Dina learns to become a character of faith of her own, later taking up the practice herself. Sadly Talia was killed, and Dina declares a lasting vengeance to do much worse than what Tommy ever did to those who assisted Joel's murder - that is, if she were to find her sister's killers.
As for when the optional dialogue appears about Dina expressing her faith, It's an ordinary conversation that happens when Dina and Ellie make it to the synagogue and the prompt shows up shortly after you explore the location as Ellie. To anyone familiar with Ellie's past they would know she's irreligious and so I found this conversation to be of great meaning to their relationship.
Ellie: ""Do you still pray?"".
Dina: ""Sometimes, I said one when we left Jackson. … Sometimes I just say little ones to myself.""
Ellie: ""Does it help?"".
Dina: “I think it calms me. Helps me put things in perspective. It’s a way to deal with grief, a way to show respect. It’s what I know.”
Yeah I know, the dialogue is super quick and short, and as much as it leaves me wanting so much more story about Dina's past, her relationship to Judaism and the history she had with her mother and sister, the single thing I love about these writing choices are how they seamlessly weave something revelatory about Dina's inherent nature into the narrative and immediately put me in a position where I now know more of what kind of a person she is in just a few minutes.
I understand her far better because of this, as well as why she's had this particular power over her trauma. I think Gene Park wrote an excellent article that briefly touched on this last year. Have a read if you're inclined to.
Note: While on the farm, you can also find an image of Dina and her sister too. Almost everyone in this game essentially has a ""north star"" that guides them towards good decisions when they feel powerless.
Owen finds it in the Fireflies, Abby in Yara and Lev, and Ellie in Joel. To me, seeing her hold on to this image of her sister speaks to how much of an impact she is still having on her. TLOU2 is always sprinkled with these bits of hope and I love it.",0.6105512380599976

I can understand if you say the game did it better but i dont see how it was bad.
The show changed a lot of scenes and reordered a bunch to their liking, which is really what i think is throwing people off. Like i firmly believe Tommy is involved as Jessie hinted to with the rendezvous; and the Joel and Ellie talk which will clear the air between them, etc.

comments discussing characters of the game,It would have worked better if you started the game as Abby. re-contextualizing Joel was a monster in her eyes. Would have also let you meet her friends and actually give a shit when Ellie slaughters them.,0.6231819987297058
comments discussing characters of the game,"You do make a valid point. I just think that the game had to play out the way it did so that we could aggressively reconsider our plot for revenge after we did everything we did. I just think about how brutal and unapologetic I was in trying to get to Abby and killing her friends along the way, then when it flipped to her perspective, I was feeling a bit guilty. I can see why it's hard to feel guilty for the person who killed one of the best characters in gaming but perhaps I was too prepared to see him die, that all I wanted was for it to serve the story better than 'bad evil cult is bad.' So when you start playing as young Abby and you start picking up that she's the doctor's child, you think back to that day that we killed the doctor. You can't have those emotions if you find it hard to justify Ellie's revenge for half the game.
Weirdly enough, I felt the worst when you see Mel's dog in Abby's side. Throughout Ellie's timeline, I always felt bad for killing the guard dogs but then I thought, 'they must be savages if it belongs to one of these guys.' 'Stupid dog' says Ellie after she stabs it to death (obviously in self defense). Then it cuts to Abby's story and we see Abby walking about her daily life like Ellie did in Jackson and Mel's dog is there just being a playful and friendly dog. It's so crazy to see that this was the moment where it got me. This is part why the editing worked for me. The promotional material that I saw along with the first few hours of the game made it feel like the game was about getting revenge for something (assuming it's Joel's death) and religious cult and some militia are bad guys. When the halfway point hit, the story just had a purpose.
This is a bit long winded, but I really do understand your way of looking at it. If I had waited years for a sequel to Batman Arkham Knight and when it finally comes around, Batman is killed by Nightwing and then we have to play him, I would of course be frustrated if that wasnt marketed properly but to me, Joel's death was only a matter of time and it happened because of something that we just did in the ending of the last game.

comments discussing characters of the game,"This is a nice sentiment, and to the fans in pain I hope the solidarity helps. That said, these are nowhere near close to similar for me. Joel wasn't disrespected, he was a victim of self-justified revenge. And while I can understand the confusion/disappointment/bewilderment at the reveal of what Abby's connection to Joel is, the idea of such a person being driven to the cruelty that we see fits the established world and tone.
This wasn't a your mama joke in the middle of a space battle. It wasn't drinking alien tit milk straight from the source while grimacing at the camera. It wasn't trying to kill your nephew because of a bad dream. It was just another horrible moment perpetuated by horrible people in a horrible world. And I dont have a problem with that.

comments discussing characters of the game,"This might be a late reply, I haven’t looked back at this thread in a minute. But I understand why some people have posted comments stating that these two aren’t comparable. They are quite different in their own ways. But I honestly do feel they share striking similarities.
Both TLJ and TLoU2 feel like extremely contrived stories. Rian Johnson and Neil Druckmann wanted to tell very specific stories, regardless of whether or not it would feel like an organic follow-up to the previous titles. They both force previously beloved protagonists into extremely contrived (and nonsensical imo) scenarios just to get them out of the way. Luke was disrespected and killed off in a manner that didn’t make any sense, just so we could make room for Rey in a more expedient fashion. Joel was killed off so that Neil Druckmann could tell his forced revenge story, and so that he could make room for Abby.
Joel saving strangers in the middle of nowhere, and then proceeding to follow said armed strangers into a cabin only for him to reveal his identity was not only careless, but out of character as well. It was an oddly altruistic decision to save these strangers with whom neither he nor his brother had any connection to or knowledge of; Joel would never have gone completely out of his way for strangers in the previous title, much less allow himself to get comfortably surrounded by them. He didn’t even attempt to put up a fight. I know they had guns on him, but I still feel like the guy would’ve at least maybe grabbed the club and put Abby in a headlock to hold her hostage or something. I’m not a fan of the rest of the game, but this event set into motion the rest of the story and it’s what bothered me the most by far. I have no problem at all with you liking the game, in fact I wish I could enjoy it. But I just can’t force myself to get into something that I genuinely do feel is bad. But that’s just me.

comments discussing characters of the game,"For sure it's possible, but I'm inclined to think that they'll lean towards a more consistent switching split perspective beginning much earlier than in the game (but not necessarily right away). In the series podcast they talked a lot about how a TV show gives you way more opportunity as a writer to explore other characters' perspectives than a video game does. And I seem to remember them in either the podcast or some article saying that they don't think the Part 2 perspective format would work super well for the show because it would mean having that awkward chunk of episodes that focus on a new(ish) character and not the established characters that viewers will already be invested in. I could be wrong, though, don't quote me on that.
Personally, I think intertwining Abby and Ellie's stories/perspectives from earlier on would make getting viewers to sympathize with Abby and her crew more effective. I mean, there are a lot of people who loved the game as a whole, but couldn't give less of a shit about Abby even after playing as her for hours, especially in comparison to Ellie. Ellie's got a whole game/season's head start in regards to establishing an emotional connection with the players/audience, so if I was writing the show and wanted viewers to be conflicted in the ways the game was going for, I'd take every opportunity to give Abby a fighting chance.",0.629143238067627

Edit: I see some people further down have a problem with ""forced"" diversity.

The best story elements come from the flash back moments between Joel and Ellie. It felt like in those moments we got to see the characters acting in line with how they were written in the original, rather than trimmed down retconned personalities we received in the bulk of this sequel.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Just to chime in, I saw both sides of the Reddit war over this game both before and after it launched.
And what I saw was that a very small minority (the usual suspects, it seems, every subreddit has them) were flailing their arms over ""LGBT inclusion"" and how they ""don't want it in their videogames"".
But the overwhelming majority of dissent (especially regarding the leaks and early launch impressions) was more to do with narrative decisions, ""inconsistent"" character motivations, and the high level directorial choices involved in what the devs themselves acknowledged would be a ""controversial"" sequel. The first game was hugely beloved and cherished, so anyone who felt that the sequel was ""disrespectful"" of its predecessor in any way were not exactly silent on the matter.
Me personally, I don't really have a horse in the race, as I've only seen snippets of livestream gameplay, and I like to form impressions based on what I personally play and experience. But I just thought some clarification was necessary, as a lot of legit criticism around this game is too handily dismissed by people making strawman arguments like ""oh you're just sexist bigots who can't stand strong lesbian women in games"", when in reality only a very small vocal minority cared about any of that.

I largely avoided spoilers which is nice.

I've abandoned a lot of games midway through recently and although this is a pretty lengthy game IMO I'm engrossed enough to see it through.
I think it could be argued that the gameplay is generic and repetitive, but enjoyable regardless. I think that although the gameplay is simplistic it's well done.
The cutscenes, story, characters,dialogue is really where the game shines. I generally don't critique stories and merely allow myself to be led and for me it's clear that they know how to construct an engrossing and entertaining story, even if literary experts could give a more damning appraisal.
I'm confident that it's a game I'd like to replay on a couple of years so I might sell my copy and rebut it digitally along with the first entry.
I'm also thinking that I'd like to pick up Assassin's Creed Odyssey which I put down about a third of the way through as it too has an enjoyably paced experience.",0.6150878667831421

comments discussing characters of the game,Someone has a TL;DR?,0.605735719203949
comments discussing characters of the game,"First off, I want to say that your thread does a fantastic job at analysing both the importance of the flow of time as well as the effects of how one goes about handling and focusing on what aspects of that flow. You provide great coverage at the actions of ideologies of all four Lords with regards to time, and I think your individual coverages emphasise the overarching theme of time on Fodlan and how Fodlan thinks of time. Nice job.
With regards to your final comment about Rhea's S-support, I believe Rhea's comments of Byleth sharing some credit and responsibility for bringing them together at that moment, changing Rhea's views about Byleth, and resolving her conflicts, aren't just from Byleth's (the player's) decision to fight against Edelgard and alongside Rhea. I believe her statement also stems from Byleth's actions that allowed the S-support to occur in the first place: Taking the conscious effort to build up support and a relationship with Rhea.
Though I am paraphrasing, as you mentioned yourself in her analysis, with Rhea alone in the flow of time, she has no intimate or friendly interactions with anyone but Byleth. Through mentally torturing herself with her obsession as well as the horrors she faced back in the Red Canyon and the war against Nemesis, she's essentially become accustomed to being isolated, even if she subconsciously knows of her internal torment and guilt. Developing such normality is expected if one's life and conflicts only repeat and become heightened as generations and centures go by. By taking conscious efforts to develop a closer bond with and know more about Rhea, it gives some context into some of the events involving Byleth and Rhea later on that don't involve conscious player choice (e.g., freeing Rhea from Enbarr yourself instead of having just Seteth or the Resistance Army do it). Rhea herself expressed doubts and reservation in her B support as to why Byleth was still engaging in conversation with her when it wasn't mandatory, for example.
Tying this all together, I don't believe it was only Byleth choosing to side along Rhea and Byleth being a mix between a human and progenitor god(dess) that results in Rhea to change her views towards him/her and resolve her conflicts in her S-support. From actions such as choosing to develop an optional deeper bond with Rhea (which is how her optional S-support and full salvation is reached), it provides much more context and understanding as why Byleth chose actions such as saving her from the crumbling monastery wall at the Battle of Garreg Mach at her surprise, and freeing her him/herself in Enbarr. I believe Rhea's comment of not everything being due to fate and time in her S-support stems from these factors as well.
EDIT: Added mention that because Rhea's S-support and full salvation of her inner conflicts and her outward isolation are optional themselves in the only route that allows for it, achieving it means all the bond development beforehand is mandatory for the player/Byleth to consciously pursue. This gives further evidence to Rhea also referring to these efforts from Byleth in her S-support comment.",0.6012822389602661
comments discussing characters of the game,"Thank you for the kind words! You raise a fantastic point—one that I honestly didn't experience in my playthrough because it slipped my mind that Rhea's B and A-Supports are locked before the time-skip. By the time I realized, it was too late and I had to catch up via YT videos. In hindsight, spending that time trying to build up support (with no other benefits to it like battle stats) brings more emotional stakes and pathos to the Silver Snow route.
For better and for worse, the support mechanics make it difficult to see all the sides of each character. I didn't realize how many revelations about characters are hidden behind supports that don't seem critical at first (ex. Edelgard and Manuela's B and A-Supports).

comments discussing characters of the game,"A really fantastic write up. It really does sum up the theme of the game. Each one of our main characters suffers from their own personal issues and trauma, and ultimately it influences everything about them - what they want to change, personal blindspots, flaws and strengths. It makes them all fascinating and understandable.
In each of their endings, your chosen lord and Fodlan as a whole is able to move forward. The game doesn't give us a straightforward right answer as to what way it should be. How will you break the cycle? Can you do it without hurting others? Can you do it without hurting yourself?
I think that's why it's so personal to them, why people so desperately want to prove that their path is right, or moral, or justified. It's part politics, part personal growth. The game offers us no definitive answer to whether anything was right or necessary. You just have to go with what you believe it right and cut a path to a brighter future yourself.",0.6098374128341675

Every character is fighting to break the violence, oppression, and pain inflicted on them by the system, and the true tragedy of the game is that that same trauma that drives them becomes a barrier to an ending where they can all understand each other I have my nitpicks with the writing, of course, but I think they did a really great job of tying it into modern struggles and politics, which is why it’s been resonating so strongly.",0.6104738116264343

comments discussing characters of the game,"I'm glad that you enjoyed it (hard to predict if I can keep an essay engaging after 5000 words!). The conclusion to the Church route and Byleth's sudden conversion into a paternalistic leader of the entire continent is just...strange. The statement in the ending tapestry that Byleth becomes the ""arbiter of every soul"" does not sound like a great future to me either.
One cycle of history ending doesn't mean the next one has to be an improvement, I suppose—I just wish that there was more opportunity for conflicts of ideals between Byleth, the other BE characters, and the Church leadership. There aren't any voices of dissent as you march towards the route's ending. It's the limits of a silent protagonist, but at least in Blue Lions you get a constant tension between Dimitri's will and the perspectives of characters like Felix.
And it's good to hear more about how this game's themes interact with the FE series as a whole. The dragons are a rather potent symbolism for a cycle of revenge, something that can twist people into monsters (hell, Dimitri can demonstrate that without being a dragon).

comments discussing characters of the game,"Thanks Federok—I hope this helps enrich your experience of all the other routes! One of the difficulties of analyzing this game is that so much of the themes and plot is revealed only after you integrate the four storylines. It would be unrealistic to require that every fan talking about the plot finishes 150+ hours of gameplay first, though.
It’s a fine balancing act to write characters that you may not necessarily agree with, but completely understand in terms of motivations, thematic roles, etc. On the whole, 3H’s writers handled that challenge well. That character dynamic / dialectic would be weakened with a fix-it route, but I’m still torn about the idea. I’d take any DLC with more character interactions at this point (hell, even a beach episode), but I hope that they keep the themes consistent.",0.6076076626777649
comments discussing characters of the game,"Thanks for reading, and thank you for all your lore analysis / summary posts—those references really helped out as I was writing. I was taking some time to reflect on your comment, and I wanted to throw in a more personal viewpoint and talk about what makes Dimitri’s perspective on the past sympathetic to me, even if he isn’t necessarily as progressive as Edelgard or Claude. Others have commented on the endings, but the ending blurbs are so brief and vague that it’s hard to use them alone to judge an entire character. I think that part of the division in sympathy for either Dimitri or Edelgard is because people tend to have either strong consequentialist or deontological moral values, and they’ll align with the character that matches those values. We also have our own preferences for the past and future as well. Those disagreements can’t be hashed out through video game character analysis alone, so I’ll explain how someone awkwardly in-between those categories sees it.
Something I wasn’t able to fully describe in the essay is how the past and future-oriented perspectives also symbolize ways of relating to people. The past is connected to / defined by one’s relationships to others, whereas the future is defined by personal liberation in the sense of not having to trust others or be tied down by them. Liberation appears to be a universally positive thing—who doesn’t want to be free? Focusing on freedom alone, however, can be taken to extremes like the pursuit of any other ideal.
Edelgard’s eternal perspective is an important and necessary tool that can be used to think around moral or societal issues, but eternity is no place for a human being to live. Trying to constantly take the impersonal “view from nowhere” is like dwelling in the vacuum of space. You have to distance yourself from your own support structures, the foundational beliefs that make you who you are, to get to that place of impartiality. I would argue that the choice to ignore those ties to others is itself a partial view that favors objective distance over social connection and collective intelligence.
I’m reminded of Edelgard and Dimitri’s conversation before the final fight, and their ideas of strength and weakness. Edelgard has the power to say that “If after all of this you believe the weak will still be weak, that is only because they are too used to relying on others instead of on themselves.” When Dimitri replies, “Perhaps someone as strong as you are can claim something like that. But you cannot force that belief onto others. People aren't as strong as you think they are,” and speaks about the people changing the world, he is making a case for social connection as a path for people to grow and defy history.
It may be impossible to maintain total impartiality and freedom from our roots, but we can still develop empathy for a different perspective. Dimitri still disagrees with using the future to justify “throwing away lives” in the present, but he takes a major step forward in being able to plan for the future and justify fighting for a better world. It is true that Dimitri’s ambitions aren’t as directed at specific political reforms (besides amending relations with Duscur). However, as a result of his focus on the present and the ties that bind people together, he is deeply respectful of individual freedom and loss. It leads to a slower pace of change than a top-down implementation of meritocracy or demolishing the church, but I don’t see his path as simply obedience to tradition.

comments discussing characters of the game,"[SPOILERS AHEAD!!]
So there has been a loud group of people who bashed the game for all wrong reasons before the game came out and after the game came out for a short span. But since then fanboys of the game have been jumping on the love bandwagon towards the game and whenever they comment they depict the game as if it's the most perfect game of all time. They say like ""I don't understand why people don't like this game"" or ""I loved the story, what problems does people have?"" as if its the problem on the audience's part rather than the game's part. So here is the list of actual problems TLOU 2 has from someone who didn't hate the game, but didn't like it either.
NOTE: Bear in mind that I DIDN'T LIKE the first game at all. I hated Joel and i hate Ellie in this game because she is acting the same way as Joel(from First game) now.
-The game's message contradicting with the gameplay and sometimes, with the story itself::
So the game's message is ""revenge is bad"" or ""violence is bad"" or ""actions have consequences"" according to people(including me). All these messages are shown by the game but it just doesn't work since Ellie has to kill so many enemies while clearing out a level or when Ellie was gonna find Abby she killed so many of her friends and tortured them even though they hadn't done anything wrong to her. She killed so many people, and didn't face any consequences for it. And at the end(I am on Abby's side though) she let Abby go?? As much as I loved that she let her go, it didn't make any sense if she's gonna kill so many innocent people to find Abby and let her go just because she saw a flashback with Joel. Like c'mon, she should've faced consequences for killing tons of people on her way but she didn't. By doing this the game kinda tells how only Abby and Joel and Ellie are people with value and everyone else is just an obstacle you have to clear, so they don't really have any value.
-Characters::
Seriously, say what you want but this game failed miserably at doing characters the right way. Everyone felt off except Lev and Yara. Nobody had enough development to be able to feel for them. Many characters were also killed and THEN we got to spend time with them but by that point, I just didn't care because I know they're dead. Ellie felt like a dumbass who is blind for a revenge even though she knew Joel was wrong(and c'mon,we all know he had it coming). I just couldn't have sympathy for her. So you may know by now that I love Abby and hate Ellie. Joel was kinda redeemable in this game, though I certainly didn't really feel for him when he was beaten to death(he tortured and killed tons of innocent people in the first game, so why?).
So the only characters I actually loved throughout the whole fucking game were Abby, Lev and Yara. Everyone else felt bland, and that's the thing I don't understand. We had moments spent with them, the dialogues felt natural but I still couldn't care about them. They didn't have the magic that the characters of RDR 2 had. Or even the first game had( I know I hated it but the characters certainly had a charm that made us feel for them, in this game that charm just isn't there). Though I would like to point it out because many call it a criticism, Joel certainly wasn't out of his character when he said his name and location on Abby's place. He had changed a lot now, and it made sense. So that's an invalid criticism.
-Much longer than needed::
Yeah, I loved the gameplay(I loved the gameplay of the first game too) but seriously the story dragged so much longer than needed and there were enemies at every corridor I got fed up of the repetitiveness and tediousness of the gameplay. Also yeah, there were certainly a lot of parts that could be cut and it wouldn't make much difference. I don't know why devs do this. Even though RDR 2 is my favourite game, it felt too stretched out than needed, and this game did the same even thought the first game didn't feel like it had any fillers. This game had tons of fillers and after 20 hours I was wishing for the game to end.
-Not enough memorable moments::
Ending was the only memorable thing for me. The happy moments were there but certainly not impactful(Joel flashbacks were awesome though). They weren't as memorable as the giraffe moment from the first game or LENNNYYYYYY mission from RDR 2.
-Poor execution::
Many have said it already, but let me say this again that the story could've been much better if they had ordered the story parts in a correct manner. I can understand why many didn't like Abby. And killing off a character and then making us spend time with them? It really felt lazy. Joel's flashbacks were really good, he actually felt like a human being rather than a monster he was in the first game. But the flashbacks within flashbacks really messed my head. At a point I forgot what timeline I was playing because the game fucks up the timeline and pacing really badly.
-Out of place level::
The ending felt very out of place. Like Guarma from RDR 2. This gang comes outta nowhere in the end and they kidnap Lev and Abby and it was so Out of place it felt like they were there just for the sake of being there . Pacing felt a little bad too. Too many sections to clear out even though it was the end. I kinda liked the ending, since I now know Ellie is alone(she deserved worse, but okay) and Abby was left alive(she deserved much better) and it certainly made me feel empty. But that island level was just very bad.
FINAL THOUGHTS
Now the game had a ton of positives too. Its has great animations, great graphics, sound design, voice acting, but so does David Cage games which are far from Masterpiece. Gameplay was great IMO, and story was dull as fuck, but that doesn't mean this game deserved anything less than 5/10. It certainly doesn't deserve anything more than 8/10 too. It's a good game, but not a GOTY or GOTG material that people are making it out to be.
For me this game is 7/10, and for perspective I rate the first game 5/10. I loved it more than the first one.
But I need to give it to ND how they went for an innovative approach in game narrative(it's not really that innovative as movies and shows had been doing this for year, it's certainly a new thing in games though).
Also if anyone wants to know more legit criticisms with the game I highly recommend Skill Ups review, Moist Meter and Jimpressions of the game by Jim Sterling. All had legit criticisms that I fully agree with them. No ""SJW BADD!!"" or ""PROPAGANDA"" bullshit. Just actual reason why this game is just not as great as critics and fanboys are saying.
That's all.",0.6196555495262146
comments discussing characters of the game,"Wow, I had to opposite takeaway. I liked Ellie well enough, but as the story progressed I grew more uncomfortable with with the lengths she was willing to go to satisfy this blood feud (which is the point I'm sure).
At first I didn't like Abby (obviously), but over the course of her character arc I grew to identify with her way more then Ellie, probably because she had a chance encounter with those Scars that allowed her to actually evolve as a character.
By the time I faced off with Ellie I kind of viewed her like Isaac viewed the Scars. She just had to be stopped.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I'm really glad you liked it. I think I'll like it more the next time I play it. Playing as Abby added a lot of frustration for me. The game tried to make me like one character i wanted to kill and two i knew were going to die. I just didn't care about it. I didn't need to know. I wish Abby had a separate game where she didn't kill Joel or playing as her before Joel kills her dad. Instead of opening the game by killing the previous main character. Then it might be easier to empathize. Combat with Abby was pretty fun. The fact that her fists are brutal melee weapons makes it a lot of fun to engage in close combat. Shoot them once in the chest then smash their head in to the wall. Reminded me of Joel.
It's also easy to justify Ellies actions since it's mostly self defense (except wanting to kill abby). First she runs in to a trap and gets captured and then they try to kill her. The number of people you kill is up to the player since many of the areas let you sneak past them. Only time Ellie frustrated me was the last section of the game where she just couldn't let go.

comments discussing characters of the game,"So first, thanks for this detailed post. Now I'll challenge some points:
On consequences
Ellie does face consequences: she loses everything because of what she does. She gets traumatized. Not only does she loses Joel, her losses include Jesse, Tommy, Dina and basically everything and everyone she loved (or tried to). While, like the first one, the game does go for a blek hopeful ending, the bleak part is the consequence of it all: the beautiful happy life in the farm is now a desolate place and she is completely lonely because she decided to go after Abby twice. MAYBE they weren't the consequences you would have liked better, but I find it a bit strange that you didn't see them. Also you and I chose to kill those people. The game is nicely crafted in that most areas with infected HAVE to be cleared to progress, but most areas with human enemies you can (at least in hard and lower difficulties) clear without killing anyone or just a couple of people, so part of the gameplay in this game makes you choose to do the killing.
About characters I think your personal bias (as in the way you experienced the game personally) is tainting the opinion on character development. Of course the subjective part we can debate all day, and could get nowhere, so I'll limit myself to the most objective aspects: the ones that can't be denied of being present. You say that you didn't care for characters if you knew they were dead. I'm sorry for you if this is how you see the value of life and dead because everyone you know today will die and I sincerely disagree that that makes your interactions and time with them not worth it. Also I can't agree with thinking that memories of those who are dead are worthless but, as I said, I think that is a personal thing and if you think death basically erases all value we on't agree on this point at all haha nevertheless here I go:
Ellie isn't a dumbass. She is blinded by rage, but it is explained in both games: she's a kid that has basically being forced to mature through trauma. Of course losing the only one relationship that feels as family blinds her with revenge. This is further fueled by her self-hatred for being distant and mean to Joel. So while not ideal, this is very human. Saying it's dumb dismisses complexity that is both explicit and implicit in the game.
Nice that you felt for some of the characters and not others. That's how we experience stories, investing in some or other characters and plots. And the reason we like some and not others can be for bad quality, sure, but here is more proof of good writing: characters are differently written, all with complete arcs, motivations, flaws, etc. Why we don't like them all? Because we are not like them all and we don't like all people either.
I agree with you wholeheartedly that it wasn't bad writing for Joel to make a ""mistake"".
Pacing
Agreed with the length and pacing. The only part I didn't enjoy for its length but I will keep defending is Seattle Day 1 with Abby. It feels long and comes at a point where it seems to be the moment for an ending (Ellie and Abby finally meet! yay) but this drag is part of experiencing Abby, the ""so-hated Abby"" and it is needed.
Memorable moments
The memorable moments are certainly subjective. I loved and found memorable that first ride into the city with Dina, as well as a lot of others with Ellie and Abby.
Going full chronological with the narrative WOULD be the poor execution option. The memories are there for a reason in the moments they happen. Remembering Ellie lashed out at Joel at the party is much more impactful when it is remembered as almost the last words they said to each other, than putting it close to the opening scene and then having 30 hours until it matters, then redeeming it immediately with Ellie saying she'll forgive him would lose all importance instead of knowing it is pushing Ellie forward to abandon her happy family once more to go get Abby. This is the same with all flashbacks we get.
Playing with time and using it to tell a story is basic in writing: in medias res has being used in storytelling since forever (just talking about Western canon we have The Odyssey doing it precisely for this same effect). You have to put the parts in the order that relate to each other in the story and not just in chronological order. It's just like when you and I tell a story, we don't narrate perfectly from beginning to ending. Just like your post and my reply are ordered by topics and not plot order discussing scene by scene and encounter by encounter.
Also the game does provide clear information to the timelines: it says when things happen (which Seattle day or how many years ago) and even characters physique and clothes are different from one another. Also the whole color palette changes. It keeps getting darker in the present while the flashbacks are usually brighter and in different places instead of Seattle, places that do look different.
What else could they have done to hold our hands in those? Seriously asking. Beyond going B&W I can't think of anything.that isn't ridiculous.
I can understand how the California part feels weird. Pacing is indeed weird. But it would be even worse (no excuse for the bad pacing) to have a big city without any big/solid group. They make a nice job out of showing how there are more societies with their own ways that are tangential to the main characters. It's good worldbuilding (weirdly paced).
What did you dislike about the island? I'm curious since you didn't go into it and you're good at making your points so I'd like to know, since I particularly enjoyed going to the Scars island even if it was all burning most of the time.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I agree completely. I feel like a lot of people who played this game missed some of the subtlety, which is completely fine.
I was completely against Ellie by the time it came back to the present day. Ellie was a monster to me, because she killed people who had nothing to do with Joel's death. She may have regretted it, but goddamn she couldn't avoid that part of herself. She had to do it, at great personal cost.
I hated that fight at the end. Not because I thought it didn't work, but because I was Ellie, fighting a diminished Abby. I didn't want abby to die. I wanted a choice.
And ultimately, that's the point. Ellie was driven so hard by Joel's death that she really didn't have one. She sacrificed her actual happy world for this. She was mentally destroyed by vengeance.
Until the end. When she remembered the conversation with Joel that ended with her affirming that she did indeed want to try and forgive him. And this she let Abby (and us) go.",0.6105074286460876
comments discussing characters of the game,"While your criticism is legitimate, I get the feeling you feel your criticism is objectively right. Your criticism is largely subjective, and while I recognize faults in the game, I disagree with a lot of your points.
First, a contradiction in narrative. Both Ellie and Abby face tons of consequences for their actions. Ellie loses her girlfriend and her pseudo-son, a good friend in Jesse, and presumably any welcoming from Jackson. She is all alone and lost her connection to Joel in being unable to play guitar. I think Abby is obvious, but she lost her lover, and her family (the WLF).
Characters were largely fine. I thought Owen was very well done, not quirky, he’s a soldier, but a soldier with depth. He reminds me a lot of the protagonist in Spec Ops. He had a moment of realization that the enemy wasn’t evil, just in a disagreement. That’s pretty damn deep. I agree on most of Abby’s friends, but Jesse and Dinah fit in pretty well with the Last of us world.
There were plenty of big memorable moments. You say you only remember the ending. How about Joel’s death? The museum flashback? Ellie murdering a pregnant woman? On Abby’s side, you’ve got the skyscraper bridge, the Rat King and Haven. I found all of those moments pretty memorable. If you didn’t find them compelling, I understand, but I wouldn’t present your criticism of these moments as objective.
The criticism I see as objective involve the game’s odd pacing, and I agree the final level felt tacked on and unnecessary (minus the final battle). You seem more concerned with proving your criticism as legitimate than actually discussing the game. You often used the word “right” when discussing your preferences for the narrative. I don’t know your credentials, but saying any narrative choice as “the right way” seems a tad biased.

comments discussing characters of the game,"There may not be an absolute correct way to structure a story, but there is no doubt the way it's done in this game is incredibly messy and it can pull you out of moments.
Abbys switch feels so jarring because it happens right at the climax of Ellies supposed plotline. You are highly invested at that point and the perspective switch completely kills all momentum and delays the ending of that story thread for 12 hours. That's way too long to leave a story thread hanging and expect the players to stay engaged.
Similarly, because you kill Abbys friends early ish in the game, you dont get the correct setup to care about those characters until way way later. It's way harder to make the player care about something they've done in the past than in the moment. Take the Ellie killing the dog scene. She had to kill that dog in the moment. She didnt have a choice. The game then retroactively trys to make you feel bad for the dogs while playing as Abby but you dont care, that moment has already passed and it was also unavoidable in that situation. How different would people have felt if you had grown a relationship with the dog before Ellie had to kill it?
Also, Abbys entire section is essentially a flashback. Then we get flashbacks within flashbacks. Her story doesnt even intersect with Ellies in basically any way until the end. Its almost like you're playing one game with one narrative, and you're yanked out and put into a completely different game with a whole new plot line. Its messy story structure.

I don't think the game is trying to make you feel bad for killing that dog. Any more than the game tries to make you feel bad for killing the girl that was playing Hotline Miami. I had this discussion in a different thread. I'm really not particularly bought onto this point about the dog. I think it's just trying to paint a broader picture of what's happening. I don't feel bad for killing the dog.
Its almost like you're playing one game with one narrative, and you're yanked out and put into a completely different game with a whole new plot line. Its messy story structure.
Yeah, I don't find that messy, really. I totally get your point about the timing of Abby's section. But I love that it felt like two different games. I really do love the dual protagonist trope so I maybe have a bias towards this. But I loved how it was done and I mentioned in other comments that I will concede that the Abby switch made the pacing falter but I feel it was narratively rewarding the way they did it.

u/brianstormIRL I'm not saying you're saying this as adamantly as other people I've seen, but the fact remains that a lot of people who are extremely against this game's narrative choices claim it has ""the worst writing ever"" and that's just not true.
This choice definitely worked for me, but I understand why it didn't work for others. I hated the switch to Abby at first, and looking back on it hours later, I love how I grew to feel about her as a character. Does this make me right and you wrong? No, not at all. People react to stories differently and that doesn't make the story ""good"" or ""bad."" On the other hand, there are legitimate ways to complain about writing, it's just a shame that with these highly divisive pieces of art (TLOU2 and The Last Jedi - another piece of bold storytelling I absolutely adored) it seems impossible for people to separate objective views and subjective views.
It comes down to amateur criticism becoming so hyperbolic that it's almost impossible to have a meaningful discussion. I think both of you ARE having a meaningful discussion right now, and that rules, but I see far too many arguments about this game that treat opinions as facts, and then narrative choices people don't agree with instead become ""sloppy, amateur writing and disrespectful to characters.""

The problem for a lot of people is that Abby and her crew has committed an irredeemable act against a favourite character.

For me, a better version of this story would be if Tommy died instead of Joel early in a scuffle at the mansion. Joel runs off to Seattle and Dina/Ellie follow. Day 1/2 play out the same but you're looking to catch up to Joel instead of Tommy. The flashbacks put into perspective Ellie and Joel's relationship post game 1, then day 3 you somehow make it that its Joel and Ellie paired up. Abby catches up to you both at the theatre and catches Joel, then do your perspective switch. After you reach that spot with Abby again, she kills Joel and let's Ellie live. This gives Ellie a legitimate reason to go after Abby again to California and that's where she learns to let it go.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I don’t really think the game is trying to tell you that revenge is inherently bad, or that violence isn’t the answer.

Whether you like her or not, Abby’s revenge is as justifiable as Ellie’s, and the narrative proves this point by having you empathize for both characters.
As for the opponents you face along that way, the game reminds you that they’re trying to survive as much as any of the characters. While they’re on patrol, they’ll talk about normal things to their friends. When you kill someone, the others will scream out their names.

Especially the people who ND named whom we have to kill to go to the next area which we have to either clear out or a cutscene will play.
The problem here is that ND brought ""consequences"" into the plot, but there are consequences only to certain characters. Every character killed hundreds of people in that game, so technically after everyone should be a personal Abby after (including Abby herself, without Ellie), so that was indeed a very weak card they decided to play.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Let me start by saying someone can appreciate the game without being a fanboy. Your dismissal on your last line is a disservice to your argument.
Now, I will go point by point.
Gameplay vs Story - I feel you miss the point big, tbh. The gameplay is very congruent to the story theme: your killings are gruesome, they feel heavy and serious, people scream in pain and cry from fear of death. The whole time I played with Ellie, I dreaded what I was doing, because it was just so obvious how much pain she was delivering over a fucked up person that deserved to die, but one she loved. Yes, you kill a buttload of guys, but this is not Bioshock Infinite: there is no disconnection from your actions and the story: they come bite you in the ass, the same way your killing on the first game also has big consequences. So I must disagree with you in there.
Characters - This is very personal, and basically your opinion on how you relate to them. That said, I do agree with you on empathizing with Ellie. From the start, I didn't agree with what she was set to do. No one told her like 'hey, Joel was fucked up, he did a bunch of shit and this is long due'. It doesn't contradict with the story or characters, but it was weird to play on this quest of psycho revenge not even on board.
Long game - I may be getting old, but I had the same problem from the first game, and also most AAA games, so I don't feel comfortable criticizing this aspect. I get impatient, feel the need to rush the exploration to get to the end, BUT as said that is a personal issue. So meh.
Memorable Moments - Boy do I disagree with you. I think the most memorable moments were actually in gameplay: The first time you meet infected and humans on the red tunnels; Abby's entire day 2 is so fucking amazing, from the sky bridges to the amalgam, and to me, the most AMAZING and INCREDIBLE encounter was the first time you meet the Seraphites on the park, on Ellie day 2. Holy FUCK if that wasn't ABSURD storytelling and atmosphere through gameplay. I was on the edge of my seat with a clenched asshole. You can't see shit, the whistles are fucking terrifying, the lighting was top notch. Literally the best part of the game for me. Also, honorable mentions to the aquarium and the dinosaurs. They were not dull, but the giraffe is hard to top.
Execution - I don't have any beef with it, BUT cutting from the climax to the second half of the game was definitely bold, lol. Surely a justifiable complaint. Tho I don't think the ordering itself was the problem: seeing all those people you killed and tortured just living really got me laughing out loud, it was a very interesting way to guilt trip you.

comments discussing characters of the game,"So something that stands out just from these comments is that a lot of people can’t actually agree on what the message is, which I think just speaks volumes on how the devs and writers executed the game. It’s not “revenge is bad blah blah blah” because Ellie doesn’t seem to change much until it’s far too late.
Now if you ask me I think they had a lot going for them, but the game just couldn’t figure out what it wanted to be. And the people involved seemed to be switching around way too many ideas. For example introducing the concept that Joel is really not a good person at all, that’s very good writing. But executed terribly because he gets killed too early and there’s not enough time to develop the antagonistic side of him.
Or take the Abby character for example, a really wasted opportunity imo. We go from playing as her, to watching her kill Joel, to then killing Jessie, then we spend like 9 hours with her, but then she brutalizes half the cast, and then we save her, but now she’s the final boss? It’s sooooo stupid and horrible writing. Like make up your mind Naughty Dog are we supposed to root for this character or hate her? Because you’re not making sense at all.
I also agree with you about how most of the characters are just pointless specially on Abby’s side. Manny and Mel are good examples. One of them spits on Joel’s face, but now he’s making jokes about getting drunk and watching anime. Um ok? Am I supposed to like this guy?

This game's mantra is cheap emotional manipulation: killing puppies, killing children, killing pregnant women (almost more than once), where people get an unexpected bullet in the face and are not mentioned again. The HARD path would be genuinely fostering attachment between all of them & the player, but except for Lev, this game skips this step because it's too hard/time-consuming.

Ellies revenge quest showed her losing herself and losing everyone. After making Nora talk, and killing Mel you could see it taking a toll on her mentally. Her loved ones are dropping like flies right in front of her and in the end her family and community are gone.
After Abby finished her revenge quest her life was going up, even after Ellie offed the remainder of her shitty friends who she was organically falling out with anyway she had new found interest in caring for Lev and finding Fireflies.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Here's how I feel:
-It pulls stuff out of it's ass. Instead of letting the narrative come together naturally, they just add new elements willy nilly, like Ellie's last conversation with Joel, or the Rattlers just kind of existing. The plot services the themes, rather than the other way around, as a well-crafted story would. Hell, the original game did this really well, as the themes of how love can make us do terrible things. And yes, I know this game continues the theme
-Manipulating the audience. Instead of letting our emotions come as a result of the scene, it's almost like it tells us how to feel. We're supposed to see Nora's death as horrifying, even when Nora was kind of a bastard who outright mocked Ellie over Joel's death. Hell, even the advertising made us think Joel would live. As a side note, I can tell they wanted to subvert expectations, but if he did live, this would actually subvert our expectations in a really cool way. Hell, if Ellie died instead, I feel it'd be even more interesting.
-Going back on it's word. Neil outright said ""We don't use the word 'Fun'"" and yet the game is actually very fun to play. It comes across as a cowardly move to make the gameplay really good if they want us, the player, to feel like shit.
-Shielding against criticism. I hate ""Woke"" things, so this is kinda biased. But they added aspects of the game that are basically designed to incite controversy, so that anyone who actually criticizes the game can be called ""Transphobic"" or something.
-Trying too hard to be ""Serious."" The first game had a bunch of genuinely dark moments of that actually elicited an emotional response from me. None of them felt forced. Yet, with this game, we have some of the most comically edgy shit.",0.6186188459396362

comments discussing characters of the game,"I haven’t played it, but that’s because by all accounts, the game makes excessive use of my least-favorite story trope: fridging. Essentially, characters the protagonist ostensibly cares about get killed left and right for the sole purpose of “male protagonist angry so they keep doing the thing,” which I view as most often used to either needlessly reinforce a character’s resolve or to force-feed the viewer some justification for an otherwise not understandable change of heart.
It’s not always the wrong choice (especially early seasons of Game of Thrones pull it off really well, IMO), but it very often is, and it feels like lazy writing; and it minimizes the value of human life by trying to call out how important human life is.
I could go on about how GoT did it well, but this is gaming; and it just doesn’t sound to me like the vast majority of deaths in this one are done in a way that respects human life, even though that’s the whole point of fridging characters.",0.6161989569664001

comments discussing characters of the game,"(I'm a bit late) Although I completely agree with some of your points, I just wanted to add that I think the game isn't about ""Revenge bad / Violence not good"", I personally interpret the game as a story about learning that Everybody is a hero or a villain in somebody's eyes. (Kind of like the cards Ellie collects lol) So for example, Ellie thinks she is doing the right thing, seeing herself as the ""hero"" who will avenge Joel. But Abby sees Ellie as the ""villain"" of the story since Ellie killed her friends. It also kind of reminds me of how Joel is seen as a Hero by some players because he saved Ellie but others think he was the bad guy for dooming the entire human race for one girl/ being incredibly selfish.Don't know if this makes much sense!",0.6113691926002502
comments discussing characters of the game,"The game was solid, but the story didn't go the way I wanted it to go. After playing Abby's segment I grew fond of her and Lev and sort of forgave her for killing my favorite character. The relationship between Ellie and Dina was cute but never went the way I wanted it to go. The ending was a HUGE disappointment I personally wanted Ellie to let Abby and Lev go after escaping and not fight, and the fact that Dina left Ellie really disappointed me they were so cute together. So all in all its a good game I would recommend it after playing the first game but tell them to not have high expectations. I give it 8.5/10 solid game",0.6011148691177368

comments discussing characters of the game,"I'd say ""dated"" rather than ""outdated"". It looks amazing for a game originally released nearly a decade ago, especially with the remaster, and it still compares favourably against many current games. It no longer looks like the state of the art though.
It's one thing to look at them side by side and say ""it doesn't look that different, and the old version still holds up really well"", which is entirely true. However, this doesn't account for how significantly even minor differences in quality can affect people's experiences of a game like this as expectations shift over time (especially with performance capture being such a focus). There's a reason why so much additional time and effort is put into art, animation, and rendering techniques for such a seemingly minor impact on the final product, and that doesn't apply any less to an existing game than it does to a brand new one, provided you have the money and resources to make the upgrade.
Ultimately, it comes down to what the studio wants people to experience playing the game for the first time. They want people thinking ""wow, this is amazing"", not ""wow, this holds up exceptionally well"". If they have funding and people available to work on it, and think it will sell, then by all means it makes sense to put in the effort, especially given the existence of the sequel and the efforts to expand their audience.",0.6007848381996155

About the proposed changes – I don’t understand why couldn’t we have a more modern game creation / browsing system with filtering, web-like responsiveness and whatnot instead of mimicking the old and cumbersome one which definitely hasn’t aged well.

comments discussing characters of the game,"The thing there though is the game is coming from a time and place in the game where there is no real distinction between myth and reality, and what's a medical condition vs what's a tangible external force in the world. And there're plenty of bits of the more 'real' world architecture, like the bridge and that bird statue, that are fundamentaly fantastical. I think the reviewer might also be coming at the depiction of psychosis from the wrong angle, and parsing the previous game way too allegorical, because the muddling and the inability to tell what is an accepted part of the world other people are interacting with and which parts are real only for you seems pretty on point. 
I think the thread in the original game they wove so well was how Senua does explicitly experience audiovisual hallucinations, but the world around her isn't a direct allegory, and you can parse the entire thing literally as a Pict woman going to hell to try rescuing the soul of her dead lover, and also she happens to have psychosis (and the existence of the fantastical doesn't make her condition go away either).",0.6048074960708618

comments discussing characters of the game,"This is weird, alot of 10s and 9s here, but also lots of 7s, the one that shocked me the most was Saudi Gamer's review, since they rarely give out a full mark, they only gave them to like 2 or 3 games in their entire history. I went and read through it and it seems like its more of a game that doesn't like to ""guide"" or teach you.
Some parts of his review that i found interesting (excuse my poor translating skills):
Pros:
Says the game is a technical masterpiece, from visuals, sound design, and cinematography. Says that animations, art direction, and level of detail are the best thing to come out from this gen.
Says that it doesn't contain any maps, or markers, making it an extremely immersive experience that is only guided by the voices ingame.
Combat only happens in specific parts, it looks simple at first, but its very exhilirating, violent, and cinematic, and there is a surprising amount of enemy variety.
Main character suffers from Psychosis, and that she learned to live with it. The Voices can range from being helpful or being quite harmful and causing you to become paranoid (from the player's end). Notes that when using headphones, it makes you feel like the voices are in your head.
Game lacks walking sections that don't feature any action going on, or backtracking, which makes it a much richer experience despite what its overall length makes you think.
Says that the Photo Mode is quite deep compared to most games, you can use it everywhere in the game, even in cutscenes.
Cons:
Puzzles are re-used in the game sometimes
(he says this is more of a note/nitpick) The game makes the combat look extremely simple in the beginning because it doesn't explain it to you much, so you are left with experimentation and discovery to find out what you can truly do with it.",0.607012927532196

comments discussing characters of the game,"Lots of folks in this thread are hung up on the combat being more or less unchanged and the first puzzle of the game being the same style we saw all over the first Hellblade.
If you like games for their vibes and their story, this is a great title. If you come to games for combat or dialogue trees or meaty puzzles, it's hard to recommend and that can explain some of the polarization.

I don't want to simplify every voice hearer down to a monolithic block but I'd guess that whoever wrote that has absolutely no real world experience of this, very particular, type of mental illness.

Why would The Council simply not destroy the bugs? If they’re enemies, why play this out like God Vs The Devil in the bible and use Earth as a battle ground, why not go to war directly with them?
You said yourself earth isn’t special and there are a billion planets with life. Why would they arm us and risk their exposure or interfere with their experiment to save us when surely they have thousands of other experiments?
Why would the current geopolitics of the world carry on as they are? Surely Russia and the US and China would have put to bed Israel/Ukraine and other conflicts to prepare for what’s coming in 2 years time?
Why have the bugs chosen this experiment to interfere with?
How did our cousins start? Did they abduct 65,000 people or or just a few and 65,000 is the result of birth?
Were at over 8 billion people with a 2 billion increase almost in my own life time, surely with unlimited supplies and far superior knowledge and technology our cousins must have a crazy population? If I were The Council I’d leave earth to burn and focus on the Erids which surely is the new human civilisation?
You were inspired by the death of your friend who wanted to speak out about the truth which likely means provide evidence or credentials, yet you chose to post on Reddit with no proof and leave it at that? Why not go to congress yourself, show half an ID card, some paperwork, anything to prove you’re even remotely involved in these departments?

Player characters are the fundamental part of the RPG and every single thing you give us to make them unique and our very own is something that we can carry with us through every single zone, patch, expansion, grand scheme.
Player rage is not the only thing that Blizzard needs to respond to and spend months iterating over, they need to respond to player positivity too.

The game has a really weird draw systems of what i truly doubt (experience) is correct and honest in its draws. Something fishy is going here.
Experience example : i had 2x 80 draws. Thats 10 red nucleus per draw for 8 times. When you are at 80/80 its garenteed ssr. With the 50% up change for a nee char you would expect to get one. I only got a crappy basic set and nothing related to the summon jn any way. But because i maxed the weapon out already it gave me 10 tokens for it. You need 120 tokens to get a copy of the weapon you want. Good luck with that. This means you have to spend about 200 euro’s to get one copy of the weapon you want.
No way!

comments discussing characters of the game,"Not only that, but a weak character means you have to maybe shelve your favorites when doing harder content (which players are asking for beyond Abyss)…
I think the bigger problems are MhY’s silence in core game mechanic issues… weak characters come and go and the community can and has moved on from past issues (Qiqi is a meme, but there’s less outrage over her today), but there are core game mechanics that are obviously creating more dramatic fluctuations in character power levels than there should be.
Zhongli was an outlier, but Geo did indeed have to be buffed a while ago (as I understand)… but they still haven’t addressed electro reactions, now target tracking, Hydro resonance’s pigeonholing into healing, and a number of other really immature design concepts that were likely early drafts of planned game mechanics that didn’t end up being what has become of the live game (like Hydro being a healing centric element - since healers exist in Cryo and pyro now).
MHY needs a “modern” patch to update those core mechanics and adjust existing characters based on those changes (like reducing electro character multipliers to balance against better electro reactions). The issue is that many people are convinced that MhY’s hesitancy is legally based since changing a gacha reward could run into some local laws (that I haven’t been able to corroborate).",0.6056122779846191

I feel like meta people are shoving us aside and treated not part of the playerbase that plays genshin, to have fun and relax after a hard day's work.
I honestly think they missed the point why each characters has their own unique traits and backgrounds. A lot of effort and resources are poured to design them, their playstyle and all.
Take example at Yoimiya's charged attack, with three mini fireworks. It greatly shows her individuality, it sucks dmg wise or usage sure, but it portrays her character really well as a fireworks creator.

Tap to create a wave to push the enemies away or hold to create a wave that would push the enemies toward the player or something. Something interesting even if she doesn't do much damage.,0.6125578880310059
comments discussing characters of the game,"There are good points.
I will comment the 6th:
It's known. GI is lacking of endgame. We have Abyss, 5 weekly bosses and World bosses. Some of them are not farmable or costs a lot of resins.
In other gachas, I don't say a character is underwhelming, it's niche. I played other gachas like Soccer Spirits, FEH, Epic Seven, Kings Raid and a lot of games I prefer to forgot.
All of them have a tons of niche characters. To defeat a specific boss, a floor in a tower or some event which a kit is necessary. In some point that ""underwhelming character"" could have the 15 mins of glory.
In Genshin Impact, we have Abyss, it has not other endgame. You could count events like Vagabond or Hypothasis fights. Though neither of them have a big requirement to obtain primos. Unless you started later or few months ago. So you build some characters to defeat Abyss and once is done. Nothing left. You can change pieces or team members.
Some gacha games have requirements on your team members. Bring some player who can stun, bring a shielder. Bring a burst healer, bring a hots healer. Bring tanky players or players who can deal a lot of damage is some moment of enemy weakness.
Genshin hasn't got anything similar. Well, Azhdaha or primo geovishap have the skill ""Bring a shielder"" though is not needed at all. So only left DPS as tool to measure characters.
As example: Fischl and Sara could be niche characters. They bring some tools to the party. More Energy regen and single target damage vs a Character with tunnel your damage to a bursty Character. Eula would love Fischl more than Sara. And Ei will prefer Sara over Fischl.
Back to requirements of the fights. Once you enter the only endgame, a counter is running. A timer which reduce your chance to get the rewards. Your goal is defeat enemies in time before the threshold. Any character who doesn't help you to beat the timer, it will be targeted as useless. Add to equation if the character is helpful though it steals time to your dps to deal damage. The help becomes into penalty.
MHY did a good job with characters. it doesn't matter which you bring to a fight meanwhile the character is well built, has good weapons, talents and artifacts. The pressure to get a character is lessen. In counterpart, niche characters are not needed and labeled as useless more often. You would see Yoimiya, Kokomi, Xinyan, Amber, Lisa, Qiqi, the traveler or Keqing. Some of them are not bad. They simply need more investments. I geared my Ayaka in less than one month. I tried to gear Keqing and after 2 months I gave up. In a month of resin I could gear 2-4 supports instead of one character.
A 5 star character could cost from zero to 200$. Build it, raise talents, weapon in case we need one and artifacts. For a F2P or dolphin, it could take months.
Another example. It's known Eula is an upgrade of Razor or Ayaka an upgrade of Kaeya. The 5 stars characters perform better than 4 stars ones. Let's say Razor is 5 stars and Kaeya too. Both have their own banner. You build them and you discover they don't improve Ayaka or Eula. The resent of pulling them is increasing. Why should I bring Kaeya instead of Ayaka wish for them when they cost money or resources? This happened with Kokomi. There is not content for her, there is not mechanics which force you to pull for her.
How to solve it? You can't unless you want to affect players game experience. Creating content which the need of some kits. Creating encounters which a trait, ability or blocking some elements. Do we remember the tower to protect? Some players just gave up to clear Abyss floor 11. They didn't have Venti or they refused to build Sucrose. (You could defeat the floor with Traveler anemo. it just the players wasn't interested) Why? Because reward vs effort is null.
So what we have? A game with a nice combat experience tied to ""bring what you want"". You don't need meta characters. A game dedicated to collectibles. Expensive ones.
In some point, users will be more selective with characters they wish unless this character brings something new. And characters who are underperfoming would be traited as trash.
Players who doesn't care for Meta characters they would wish for any waifu or husbando.
The breach between Meta character and Casual character will be increased. To avoid this kind of situation, new endgame content would help characters to being meta",0.6262050271034241

comments discussing characters of the game,"Nice thread OP, and I agree with you. My belief is likely that all of those factors combined are what actually shapes how the community has so far reacted to seemingly weak characters. Notice that 3, 5, and 6 are linked (and compound) each other - Scarcity of resources, opportunity costs, and FOMO for example play a huge role in our decision making, you know, the one that goes ""Resin is so limited so if I want to play that character I should start saving up and grinding the mats 2 weeks before their release"". This then plays into 4 (hype) which is aided heavily by slow character releases, which as you've pointed out makes character spotlights much more prevalent. Game companies obviously devote a lot of resources into making those hype trailers, livestreams and character spotlight to achieve maximum psychological effect in attaching these characters to specific Identities that people can relate to.
What usually happens is the moment the character appears and becomes someone we like, they are so unique that either 1. we relate to the character, or 2. we need the character for social proof as we see our peers (or other individuals) relate to the character. This is where we now say ""I am/We are insertcharacter main"". Then we start grinding their mats, and as a result have devoted time and resin (resources) which further reinforces the identity that we've somehow attached ourselves to. And the trailers become the nail in the coffin until we pull and somehow regret the decision (leakers don't help with this either).
The next part is really the feeling of regret, denial, FOMO and hope that leads to countless google searches along the lines of ""This can't be, this character isn't good? But I've done so much to prepare for her! What do others have to say about this?"" Once we find various opinions, we reach conclusions through confirmation bias or feel that our identity is being associated with ""weak"" (but usually both ends up happening) and as a result feel the need to defend our identities by either screaming at the problem or the source of it, or finding likeminded individuals who can pat each other on the back and... well, something about numbers makes things 'better'. Eventually, we start to care less and move on to the next character, and say something like ""oh I'll just get this other character to help with my abyss/boss/anything that the current character cant do...""
There's way more psychological factors playing here, and I could be wrong about so many things for sure, so I'm interested to hear if anyone has more to suggest or fix. In the end, many of us fall to psychological tactics, and companies know and leverage this. You can usually tell how strongly the psychological factors employed are affecting the userbase by the amount of backlash created when a product/function fails to meet the users' expectations.

comments discussing characters of the game,"I spent a lot of time researching Raiden prior to and after release. I own a Raiden with a EL and a good Fate set. No matter how people spin it, to me Raiden is a niche character along the lines of Mona and Albedo. They're strong in very specific teams and can be slotted into others, but are not the most optimal pick. For example, Beidou and Fishl are just better characters for a lot more teams. Raiden has three conditions you need for her to be better than those two:
- You need a team with high-energy Bursts and strong Bursts to buff. This makes her weird with characters like Yanfei and Childe because they don't rely heavily on bursts. On the flip side, Fishl and Beidou are much better Sub- DPS characters than Raiden is, the ratio on Raiden's E isn't ratio high compared to those two.
-You need a team that likes Electro or can overcome its weaknesses. Consistent Electro application can be screwy to some compositions. Even the current Raiden National team has some problems with Overload and why it's better off versus bosses than tons of mobs. So you need an Electro or Physical team OR a team so cracked that they can just ignore the downsides a.k.a. the basicaly six-star National team.
-Lastly, she consumes field time so you actually want Raiden to be your main carry in most compositions. It's a weird fine line because some comps can fit her 10 seconds in and others can't but you do ideally want time for her. So she's good in teams like National who has no main carry and Eula, because Eula has a decent downtime with her Burst.
The problem with talking about good and bad and niche is that everyone has their own opinions on it. To you, this might be a what's a good character. These characteristics make her niche too me. If a new player asked me if they should pull Raiden if they wanted to make the strongest account possible, I'd only say yes if they had very specific characters ready to go. I definitely think she's fine, though I'll confess that Electro is my favorite element so I was hoping that the ultimate Electro character would've been absolutely cracked. Also, I do think that the Beidou interaction should be fixed, that would make her so much better.",0.6080986857414246

comments discussing characters of the game,"I'll prolly get downvoted for this but it goes beyond me.

Why would I care that Eula can nuke everything with her ult if I'm not facing one? Why would I care that Yoimiya is regular in comparison to others if I'm not using her on an arena.
Some people talk about resources and not wanting to spend on those characters, then don't. Don't pull for those characters, don't build them, wait for banners to be active for a while and people testing those characters before you pull.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Il not mad that Kokomi is bad i throw everything for Raiden anyways, i have nothing left for her, but if people are mzd that she's bad, that's because the character designers did their jobs right to make this character appealing for people, but her kit isn't good enough for a 5* i guess.
Kokomi is the first healer limited 5* in the game, she is not designed to deal damage but they still tried to make her kit unique, bit we start to reach the end the new ideas i think, raiden is the energy recharge character and kokomi the heal bonus character ( i think ?) I wonder what scaling the new 5* will have.

comments discussing characters of the game,"There's a few problems that I've witnessed. Number 1: genshin is the biggest gachq game on release and even surpasses Warzone in terms of concurrent players.
2: mihoyo is very stringent when it comes to rewards and free resources. This in tern makes an entire banner just feel utterly useless. ""Why did I grind for 2 months for kokomi if she's trash?"" ""Now I'm mad""
3: genshin impact is really the first game since Summoners War that has accumulated a non-gacha fan base. You have people like me who doesn't even like anime (not that there's anything wrong with it) and I still enjoy the game.
4: this one is probably reaching a bit and it's my own personal view. But I feel like the world in general has become absolutely restless. People are agitated, irritable, and just down right unsavory if you ask me. No more than 2 years ago if a dev from a game company got a death threat it was pretty big news. Now it seems like anyone tied to mihoyo is getting death threats left and right. Like it's no big deal. Idk, there's just no reason for people to get so up in arms over a video game like this.
People forget that it's alright to not have a busted character, a broken card, or OP weapon in games. Not everything is meant to be game breaking like ganyu. Or meta defining like zhongli. It's just like in fighting games. Not every character is going to be busted. With genshin impact it's almost silly to be sending death threats over a damn character because literally EVERY character is viable. It's a pve game. You could play dps Barbra and beat the entirety of the game. I'm rambling. But it just seems silly that people are so upset over characters not being ""broken"".

comments discussing characters of the game,"the resin systems a bitch
8 min for 1 resin when you need 20 for most activities.
the artifact system is a bitch
domains cost too much for the pitiful rewards they give.
the boss mat drops is a bitch
for 40 resin you get one gold glad or wanderer and 1-4 boss mats making it so you need to do this around 15 times to bring a single character up.
the weapon leveling is a bitch.
again domains cost too much for basically nothing.
building up a new character and not having prepared the materials a month in advance is a bitch.
like sheesh i understand we need to grind, im all for the grind, but good lord man is the resin system so demoralizing and the artifacts so mentally draining when you grab a good main stat only for the substats upgrades to ignore all the good stats and drive it all into hp or def or flat stats. so of course players are going to have torches and pitch forks when a character isnt great. WE GO THROUGH HELL TO MAKE SOMETHING PLAYABLE ONLY FOR IT TO BE MEH. its frustrating, but this problem comes from mihoyos aversion to buffing resin regen. until the resin system goes 1 resin per 4-5 minutes or domains, world bosses, weeklies are cut in half this will forever be an issue. they also could just double the rewards from these activities and stop being so stingy with everything. this is my personal thoughts as a player who has been on the edge of quitting the game for a while, but is holding on to some hope called ""they will hear us eventually""",0.619021475315094

I especially resonate with your point that most of the ""interesting events"" in-game arise from the player seeking them out, which can feel rote and programmatic, rather than the player just exploring and being confronted with situations they cannot easily ignore. Games like Dragons Dogma or even Skyrim are proof that you can respect ""player freedom"" without making the player so ""free"" that they have to consciously opt in to any form of incidental world content. Sometimes I'd just like the game confront me with some shit that requires engaging with a particular gameplay loop to deal with.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Your language of ""missing"" suggests that the game is incomplete or unfulfilled or in some way wanting. You also write as if these are things that would improve the game but aren't quite essential to its success. I agree with the latter, but I don't think the former is a fair negative evaluation of the game. That isn't to say you are negatively evaluating the game on those grounds, but it seems you/others might be! If they aren't criticisms, ignore that point :)
Having fan support for certain features is a nice thought, but on the face of it doesn't seem wise, for the creation/implementation would become contingent on support for particular ideas rather than the game overall, so the implementation of some ideas would be at the expense of other ideas, to the dismay of fans who supported unrealized ideas. There are surely ways to design funding to avoid this kind of scenario, but they also get in the way of overall funding. It also gets in the way of creator control and vision: these ideas may have been part of an initial plan for the game, but the creators have changed that vision and come up with new (and better, in some cases) ideas! To fund an entire team dedicated to balancing fan want and designer control would be a large ask, both financially and critically.
These are just rough thoughts/reflections in light of your post, but I hope that all makes a little sense! For my own part, I love what the creators have done with the game, how they've made it available, and how they've balanced it all against the initial trailer.

comments discussing characters of the game,I totally agree with the statement I think it has become a fine game but the one element to me that has been mainly left untouched is the Flora and fauna like I can land on the planet with like these predatory looking creatures and it's rare that I get attacked by one or like some kind of man eating tree like it's a lot they still can be done with the ecosystems I hope that some of the next updates are inclusive on that front a And outer space could use a few more features I would love a spacewalk where you can get outside of your ship while you're in space and like land on asteroids to mind them for even more rare resources and you have to have oxygen in a really good negative zero protection rig to keep from dying while you're out there and of course I can add like some kind of creatures that would attack you while you're trying to mind the resources,0.6222257018089294

comments discussing characters of the game,"Sorry OP, I get what you are saying and I see the love you’re showing but respectfully disagree with the fundamental request. In short: HG owes us nothing. Maybe others disagree but I feel like your post comes across a little entitled.
It’s been so many years and HG has more than “made up for” their infamously poor launch of NMS. They’ve cleared their debt and then some. They owe us nothing. We all know ow that trailer was hand crafted. I’ve never heard of ANY other game or movie or anything that’s so meticulously criticized after so many years.
(It kinda feels like saying to Tolkien, “in 1923 you wrote that there were SIX wizards. You promised us six. Where’s the last one?”)
(OK not the best analogy but you get the jist)
Re: a request for a kickstarter. No. It’s called “buy more copies of NMS.” Assuming that HG isn’t burned out on developing this game going forward, they’ve earned the right to do whatever they want next. If they want to introduce new robot species plot rather than make interactive herds that knock trees down… I’m fine with that.

comments discussing characters of the game,"Brah, no offense, 8/10 needs to be read like a low B in this situation.  These aren't movie or music reviews where a 5 is average, they are game reviews that have always inflated the scores so about 8/10 is average.  This has been true for AAA videogames since at least the early 2000's when I first paid any attention to them.  Game reviews tend to be soft since they get a lot of bonus points just for being complete and functional.
All an 8 really means from most outlets here is that it functions well enough, checks the standard boxes expected of an AAA, and lasts long enough that most people won't feel short changed.
What's more, the reviews here are not all ""8's and 10's"".  As of this comment, it is averaging an 82, which suggests that there are plenty of 6's and 7's being given as well...which there are.
What I am reading is the same thing I read for many forgettable AAA games...it's average.  ",0.6077539324760437

comments discussing characters of the game,"Reading the reviews absolutely cements to me that if Yasuke were not black he would have been cut from the game a long time ago. I'm convinced that if he were just some generic white guy called John Smith shoehorned into the game, they would have had no issues cutting him to focus exclusively on Naoe, especially since Ubisoft copped so much heat for shoehorning in male protags in previous AC titles. Ubisoft's refusal to make a mainline AC game where you play as a woman and there's no male option shoved in there has long been a point of criticism.
Yasuke is mechanically weak and undermines a lot of the game's design, and multiple reviews have talked about this. He feels shoehorned into the game as an alternate combat-driven playstyle that doesn't really work with the game's overarching stealth and traversal design pillars. It's jarring and weird and overscoped. But Ubisoft backed themselves into a corner. If they removed Yasuke it would be seen as a political statement and a victory for the wrong kind of people -- simply because he's black. So they were stuck with him.",0.6211745738983154
