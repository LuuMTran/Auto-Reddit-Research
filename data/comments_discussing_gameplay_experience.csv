comments discussing gameplay experience,"I've read throughsome comments and its mostly crashing and VRAM issues alongside stuttering.
I wonder how many of those are related considering i've seen the 3080 and a few other 8GB GPU's mentioned a few times. Seems like PC gaming with the recent wave of titles is clearly moving into 8GB minimum for 1080p high/maxed out settings and at least 12GB for anything 1440p and beyond.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"If you guys actually read the reviews, a lot of them (Both positive and negative) are written emotionally, which isn't helpful
Positive:
You have my money, now port your other games - Nothing about the actual game
Negative
100% CPU utilisation in menu - That's shader comp, don't complain unless you like shader comp stutter
Length of shader comp - Don't complain, otherwise you have a dead space where it doesn't do it properly, and you still have stutter
Crashes - valid complaint
Mouse issues - valid complaint
Fuck iron galaxy - Unhelpful
Get nixxes - The spiderman ports also had issues
High vram - Somewhat valid, depends how the game scales to lower texture settings (And this assumes you're targeting the appropriate settings for your VRAM)

The games do a good job of balancing the quips etc. In the movie it felt like they were trying to 'one up' each other with one liners the whole time.
I've got no issue with the movie not really being true to the games or anything. It's an adaptation, if I'd want the exact same thing I'll play the games :) But I do love the cheesy adventure vibe of the games, which the movie just didn't have.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I agree. The gunplay is so hard-hitting and satisfying, and so is the melee combat. It just feels good. But what really makes it an excellent gameplay experience, in my opinion, is how seamlessly you can switch between stealth and balls-to-the-wall action.
It’s not like other stealth action games where you’re trying to find the optimal way to take everyone out without being seen, or where you try to take out as many as possible before it devolves into a shootout; you’re constantly alternating between stealth and action in a way that feels reactive and emergent.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I mean there's more going on than just depression -- PTSD, survivor's guilt, and other issues. But yeah, in general I agree unironically with your comment. The game is very actively trying to put the player into the headspace of a very damaged and unhappy person. It's not an easy or joyful experience by any means. But I can probably count on one hand the number of pieces of media (not just games, media of all kinds) that have affected me emotionally like TLOU2 did.
I remember specifically taking breaks from it and playing the Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney trilogy as a palette cleanser whenever I got overloaded with anguish during TLOU2. I genuinely needed that silly, light-hearted experience to level me out because of how truly miserable I felt at times, especially during the last few acts of the story. And I totally understand that isn't the experience everybody signs up for when they sit down to play a video game.

Part of the message of the game is questioning the straight ""following along"" of the plot and the violence that occurs. It's not about answering that question, but just highlighting it.
As well, it was a commentary on the typical shooter games that were somewhat flooding the time, and perhaps the typical campaigns tacked on with them. Really, Spec Ops: The Line is about its meta-commentary, not the story.",0.6008080840110779

I think some of the lower reviews seem like they have more interesting things to say, I'm not arguing against the scores but a lot of the 10/10 are like ""it's Last of Us so it's a masterpiece"" which reminds me of Red Dead Redemption 2 and while I love that game these type of reviews can start sounding the more disingenuous ones once people start finding flaws in the game.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I think you're missing a huge point of difference there though. When a game focuses on its gameplay, it's at least focusing on something that no other medium can replicate. Take Tetris for example. All Gameplay, No Story. It is literally impossible to replicate the experience of playing tetris in another medium, because how would you even start doing that?
Same with games like BotW. Some movies or other stories can introduce an fun and expansive world, but only a game like BotW can allow me to explore it and experience the intrigue of wondering what's over that hill, then discovering it for myself in my own way. If you tried to convert that into a movie, then it would just be a movie about some random person finding stuff, which sure can be fun, but watching someone else explore something in a linear fashion, and exploring something myself in a non-linear fashion, are two completely different experiences.
But if a game works like the kind of stuff Naughty Dog puts out, where the gameplay is shallow and 1-dimensional and the story is completely linear. Then you could basically just cut out all the cutscenes, maybe sneak in some gameplay montages to serve as the action bits between, and you've basically got a functional movie without really losing much if any of what made that experience what it is.
And I never said a game can't focus more on their narrative than their gameplay. But it shouldn't be to the extent that the gameplay becomes a chore that just gets in the way of watching cutscenes. The gameplay could literally be as simple as just making narrative choices and that would be great! I've always felt that games like Detroit Become Human would be made much better if they stopped pretending to have meaningful gameplay and just played out cutscenes without dumb QTEs and made the game just about making narrative choices at key moments. But I guess they didn't want to sell a game that could be played with a TV remote despite the fact that that is a perfectly valid way to do things. course the writing in that game is also terribad but that's besides the point of what we're talking about right now
On top of that, if a game is going to focus on its narrative, then I think it's a million times more interesting if that narrative actually has some interaction. A completely linear narrative like what you find in The Last of Us to me is a very boring kind of narrative for a game to have. Again, games can be linear that's fine, but if you're gonna make your game narrative focused, I'd rather have something like Mass Effect or Disco Elysium where affecting the narrative is part of the core experience. Like Disco Elysium is a game that's entirely about its narrative, most of the gameplay boils down to making narrative choices and talking to people. But you couldn't just turn that into a movie because those interactive elements are core to the experience. And of course there's a bunch of games that have interesting emergent narratives that are formed from the player's actions.
Like I said if you made a movie whose only good feature was its sound track, then I'm just gonna want to listen to the Album instead. But if a movie focuses on its visuals, then at least it's doing something that a book or a music track can't.",0.6137977242469788

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Why though? Neil Druckmann specifically said that TLOU2 makes a point about violence, so when the Polygon reviewer contrasts the cynicism of the game with real-life human sentiment in times of hardship generally and her experience in the current crisis specifically, I don't see how this approach to criticism is somehow not legitimate.
Don't get me wrong - it's fine to disagree with her conclusion, but it just weirds me out how r/games tends to always be on the forefront of lamenting the homogenization of game reviews. But if there ever is a tepid review of a popular franchise entry where the reviewer doesn't criticize surface level game mechanics and instead writes about how they couldn't connect to the game's theme or tone, it's unfailingly met with callous dismissal and personal attacks in the comments.",0.634568989276886

comments discussing gameplay experience,"You're absolutely right, I don't need game scores to tell me how fun a game's gonna be, if you love Naughty Dog games and The Last of Us Part 1 if your favorite game, you're gonna love the gameplay in this one. Why wouldn't you? Naughty Dog didn't forget how to many games.
But if we want to accept that games can be art, then we need to accept that games reviews can exist as art critique, and that's what Polygon appears to be doing.
They're not just breaking down the graphics, sound, controls, story, and ""fun"" into 1-5 numerical ratings. They're taking the interactive story and giving it a chance to stand on it's own as a piece of art.
If you wanna find an old school game magazine review, with a numerical score, you don't have to look far to find a dozen alternatives. So I don't know why the Polygon review is razzing so many people.",0.6009706854820251

However, there have been both, reviews saying that the mechanics and the story is not that good, and reviews saying that is fucking awesome.
The best way would be to follow a reviewer that you trust and share similar opinions with, and buy based on what they say on the game.

They seem to care more about the Story, representation, voice acting, graphics and spectacles than the game mechanics themselves. Which is fine, People have different tastes. However I find it a bit weird nobody is talking about the gameplay in this comment section because IT ACTUALLY SOUNDS GREAT. This looks like an amazing stealth game with probably the best AI behavior I've ever seen in a stealth game. I don't really care if the story is bleak and hopeless and all that shit.

Also can you please add this to the list :
Events: well tbh pretty similar with the events suggestion you have so i wont add here
Characters:
- Balance Male to Female characters, I would like if they balance the amount since in my opinion it is pretty jarring considering the amount (as a female player who loves both the Female and Male characters or the game, I know they could do well and they also design good characters overall)
-Buffing old units both 5 and 4 stars, I genuinely love the 4 stars we have and would love just try and match up team comps (I love Aalto's taunts and also really interested with Yuanwu gameplay and ofc theirs our girls Sanhua and Danjin the goats and also fixing Taoqis gameplay, she seems interesting but quite weak)
- Having more 4 stars with good kits since I feel it can be at least an alternative if players pulling in the banner cant get the 5 star they are targeting for
Farming:
- Increase in Crystalline and Crystal solvent and the likes since us players are farming more now
-Ability to ad a specific name for the markers ex: Mining marker - Label: Mining for ""Specific ore""
Quest:
It would be nice if we have clips of like the cutscene we experienced in game (like unlockable in game) and it would be stored in Gallery, then we can have both the pics and scenes (I love rewatching wuwa scenes in YT, but I would love seeing them while in game too)",0.6014025807380676
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I mostly agree with it all besides Team Setup UI which sounds spitting image feature from Genshin but for some reason I think it's a very overrated feature that requires more work than the output it gives
It's more of a Quality of Life improvement rather than gameplay feeadback and should consider making a different category of requests rather than feedback
Same goes for 3d Character details, i hope you do realise most of these features are mostly ""Normal"" or ""Height"" texture data that gives a 3d look on a 2d plane which makes the game itself work lighter than it should be. If it were to be 3d Meshes then you would be expecting your system to calculate more voxel data which is Gpu or Cpu Intensive.

Which leads to a lot of characters only being functional with a very specific limited support and being very unfriendly to players who cannot spend or have limited spending capability. I would suggest that before Rinacita ends we get a 4 star for each element debuff or at the very least if that's too much work an echo with high uptime that can apply things like Spectro frazze/Aero erosion and stuff like that. Or even add to existing echo's that are good, like the pyro lizards so that team comps are not super dependant on getting X character with X debuff to make meta dps good.",0.6080412268638611
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Thank you for posting, that is so detailed. I think my complaints are included in these, but i will type it all over again, for my next survey yap 1.

Considering giving older characters screentime, stories or upgrades (they dont sell as hard but cmon) 4. Training room and Housing system. I want to practice with different teams and look at my characters in a house together. 5. More team comp option, fixing team choosing UI, mentioned above. 6. Tone down obvious predatory practices (mentioned in the battle pass section and in character restrictive gameplay design) 7. Actual meaningful QoLs, like unlimited flying, gacha 5050 guarantee or echo stat roll guarantee. 8. (my opinion) characters and story with built up, better lore and lore presentation. 9. (my opinion) gallery for rewatching cutscenes or story quests. I know people have problems with their hard drive but i wish to appreciate them again.

While I concede that most of your analysis is logically sound if we agree with your basic principles and definitions, I do believe that basis is built on views and interpretation of terms that are let's say, niche to specific feminist circles. So I don't think feminism was what Team Cherry designed the game as being about. What I mean is that, as a writer, I'm sure a future reader of my own comics could totally make a detailed analysis about how my story is actually about feminism. And while I care about many things like female representation, no it was not my intention. However I do believe in the inherent value of personal interpretations, no matter whether ""correct"" or not.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"incredibly well formed analysis, but i think even in your own analysis you seem to contend with the fact that feminst themes are not necessarily the central one of the game. personally though, i think your analysis really shed some light for me on how feminist themes do play into the central message of the game, specifically in the termination of generational maternal trauma, especially as a metaphor for capitalism. throughout the game the way gms created the society, and crucially the citadel and underworks areas of pharloom is shown to be intertwined with her children, the weavers. herrah breaking free from the cycle of abuse and hornet carrying that on is literally how hornet becomes a better version of herself and makes the society of pharloom better.
ill take the time to write a full analysis later, but before i go id like to note that as per your comment on english not being your first language you have fluency and command of english i only see from those who have closely studied its craft. your tone is clear and mellifluous, and your prose is concise and direct in a way that shows the immense effort you've put into it. additionally your formatting and grammar indicate a level of perfectionism suited to higher platforms than reddit, and i'm not sure your technical skill level would be completely out of place in the annals of famous novelists and poets; it's very well constructed is my point.",0.6252017617225647

I only have two criticisms, which may have just stemmed from english not being your first language as you said, but I believe you mean ""feminity"" as opposed to ""feminism,"" as a major theme in the game. The criticism of capitalism is there, but it appears to be more of a criticism of greed and industrialization, not inherently capitalism.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Most comments I've seen since the june reveal have been ""where muh multiplayer"" and ""it looks the same"".
I swear Factions wasn't this big of a deal back in 2013 but now it seems to be the hill to die on. I also feel like the gameplay and graphics comments are at best made with rose tinted glasses and at worst are just disingenuous. I mean just look at the Digital Foundry tech review. Not only are the graphics basically remade with models, world and effects being improved but also the cutscenes down to the directing and camera angles of the scenes, not to mention they are completely real time now. The gameplay also seems improved with better AI and changes to the physics and gunplay. While Joel isn't diving and dodging around like a madman in conveniently placed patches of high grass it's still an improvement.
Now, I'll admit 70€ is a bit steep but to call this just a cash grab isn't fair to Naughty Dog. It is a cash grab in the sense that it costs money (crazy, huh?!) and the PS4 is cheaper but it also seems to be the definitive version for a critically acclaimed single player story with real work and care being put into the game.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"The first game was clear on that with the DLC though? It was them being pissed off about Joel getting killed and the transphobia around Abby. One of my highest rated comments was in a post showcasing that spoiler and I remember the absolute outrage when people confirmed it was real footage. Then we got hordes of posts about how a girl's body can't look like that, she must be a man, protein powder and constant workouts can't give a woman that kind of body, etc etc.
The main reason I can remember is because my complaint wasn't about either of those things but because right wingers and transphobes were all over anything that didn't praise the game, they latched onto my comment. (For the record, my comment was about Druckmann saying if he made TLOU2 it would be about new characters and that Joel and Ellie's stories were over. I think when you have a world as big as this, it's more enticing to see what is going on elsewhere than falling back to the safety of established characters. I would've been happy if we spent 90% of the game as Abby and had a surprise final showdown with Ellie where you got clues of what happened but it really clicked then. I would've been happier if we never saw a tie to Ellie or Joel ever again.)",0.6324148178100586

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I know he did go on record in a video saying he “didn’t even want to play it anymore” after he saw the leaked footage.

Wouldn’t be surprised if he never gave it a fair shake. But maybe he ended up liking it, or maybe it wasn’t for him but he will still have a fair and constructive analysis to share.
The thing with most YouTube “reviewers” is that they are first and foremost entertainers. Even ones I agree with in general, I take their reviews with a grain of salt. And while Joe has been around a long time, he really goes all in on the entertainer angle with skits and over the top reactions.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"His review is out already and it was exactly what was expected.
It's not bad at all, he does give out some fair points for why he didn't like it but at the same time I just can't really fully consider his opinion when he clearly went in it with an almost fixed mindset after the leaks and the way he seemed to be unwilling to actually give it a chance.
He does present some fair argument against it and I understood most of it but he also goes on this rant about how basically everyone knows better then the people who actually created the characters about what the plot could've been and It's kinda funny to me because pandering to the ""woke community"" would have been outrageous which is proven by the reaction and how everyone jumped into assumptions after the leaks but had they made a fan service story, had they played it safe and made something to satisfy fans wants instead of the story they wanted to tell (aka pandering) that would have been 100% okay.
At the end of the day, I understand and can definitely see why some people didn't or won't like the story but saying this game had lazy writing and basically going on and on about how they should've done what the fans wanted is just not a valid argument for a reviewer who should have the capability of being objective and rational in my opinion.
He also contradicts himself sometimes. I mean, 6/10 is a fair rating... had he not spent 90% of the video pointing out all the wrong things they did and barely mentioning what he thought they did right. Hell, he even says in the end that gameplay was one of the things they did well yet earlier in the video he's going on about how they've only added prone...

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Angry Joe came out with his review. He gave it a 6/10. 5 years from now these review scores are going to look like jokes when the culture wars over this game dies down.
A game that has this many industry leading aspects from animation, voice acting dialogue writing, atmosphere, combat movement, stealth gameplay etc getting a 6 just because you disagree with story direction is silly.
Another thing he doesn't realize is how much of an influence he is to the gaming community. 15-25 year olds are his core base and that age group has issues with thinking for themselves. They latch on to influencer opinions. Angry Joe for all his hatred of monotization, lazy publishers etc is going to influence the gaming industry to push out generic trash and not take risks.
What's even more sad is if the leaks didn't come out where a multi-month campaign by alt-right YouTubers didn't spam hatred for the game making it the mainstream narrative amongst young YouTube viewers based on the leaks, Angry Joe would probably be praising this game.

I'm in the ""this game is a masterpiece"" camp so I may be biased but from what I can gather from most of the negative fan reviews I would hazard the guess that these boys aren't much of the ""reading"" types that value literature let alone understand complex character development and critical thinking. If these guys actually paid attention and enjoyed the typical books assigned in literature classes we would see a lot more thoughtful reviews (which does not mean you can't criticize the game) instead of ""I hate that they killed Joel! Abby bad! Foot stomp! Hmph!"" They probably also hated Romeo & Juliet because of the (spoiler alert) double suicide at the end and all the ""irrational"" decisions that led to that ending.

and for the reactionaries that are gonna jump and accuse me of saying people who don't like the game are phobes...no, that's not what I'm saying. Disliking the game is perfectly valid. Hating that Joel died..valid. Disliking the structure that forces you to play as the antagonist for a significant chuck...valid. the fucking need to pickup so much little shit...valid. There's lots of reasons, many I disagree with, but you know it's just a videogame and discussion is healthy, but plenty of valid reasons. There's criticism and disappointment.

They shouldn't be afraid to take a strong stance anyway since the game is breaking all sorts of records in sales too.

The out of character moment you mentioned is the first time I’ve seen someone mention it, it’s also exactly what I thought at the time. It felt really forced in my opinion. The whole final section leading up to the boat scene kinda felt forced to be honest... the scene itself was pretty good though.
I’ve said before the political backlash to this game has been completely bizarre. Abby’s appearance is literally a non-issue, neither is Ellie’s sexual orientation. The story though is fair ground for discussion, and I can absolutely see why some may not like it.",0.6140845417976379
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Spoilers below ——
First off - I think people are having a hard time distancing themselves from the player character. It’s been interesting seeing people say they feel like they’re being personally blamed for the damage that they’re causing in the game but I feel like Ellie is making the moral decisions herself and I’m just here for the ride.
I really liked Ellie’s section of the game, even if I found the tone to be somewhat unsettling, and thought that Abby’s was somewhat less consistent (it really did feel like a B plot) but it still had some decent highs. The final part of the game managed to reel Ellie back in for me and let her make those right decisions, rather than scarring herself further.
In terms of gameplay, it’s really good if you liked the first one, even with just the implementation of being able to go prone and use the grass. The shooting has a lot of heft to it and you can feel the brutality of every melee strike. I am disappointed shivs reappear in Abby’s section (it seemed like a great QoL change during Ellie’s) along with having to completely rebuild a character and arsenal all over again.
I finished it tonight, I liked it. I’m sure my opinion will change over time and I’ll probably replay it again at the end of the year.",0.6317057013511658

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I went into the game without watching any trailers or ads and also avoided all of the leaks, I just knew there was some drama around it. I was not surprised at all that Joel died near the beginning. I assumed for years that the second game would revolve around his death in some way (or he’d already be dead when the game started). I watched some trailers and can see why some people are a bit upset about false advertising.
I am also seeing a lot of complaints about the pacing of the story, and I agreed at first, but I think it would have been worse if the story was told in order. I also actually really appreciated the flashbacks in between the days and thought they were a great break between “modern” events. If I did have one complaint it would be more gameplay related, it felt kind of bad to start from scratch when playing as Abby, but it makes sense that the two characters have different weapons, abilities and skill trees.
I am also seeing a lot of people basing the game off of some streamer who rushed through it. Personally, I think the game is something that needs to be experienced first hand (or on the couch with someone playing it). Rushing through is also a huge disservice to the environmental story telling. I thought there was a ton of immersion when you’d read letters in the world and then you’d kill a seemingly random soldier then hear their friends call out their name. There are also so many little stories for all of the environments you’re in, like seeing an electrocuted body near a generator then soon finding out that was the previous person living in the theatre.",0.6071532368659973
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I finished the game over the weekend
The amount of negativity across the internet is really strange, especially the number of opinions stating, ""I haven't played/finished the game BUT...""
And the trophy completion percentage definitely mirrors that. It's probably higher now, but as of Sunday, the percentage for the ""Finish The Game"" trophy was around 1.8% making the sheer amount of commentary about how the game sucks quite suspicious.
Personally, I think the Last of Us Part 2 is incredible. I'm not a critic and do I get anything out of saying this (except for an inbox full of hate). I'm a long-time fan of Part 1 and was convinced for the longest time that Joel and Ellie didn't need a sequel. I honestly did not want these characters to come back because I was convinced there wasn't much more story to tell. And I'm happy to admit after a lot of hesitancy that I was wrong.
I love the characters, how they change throughout the story. And some of the unexpected reveals throughout the game were some of the biggest highlights for me.
All that being said, I can understand why the game wouldn't be necessarily enjoyable to play for a lot of people. The gameplay is quite stressful and is highly focused on desperate stealth or frantic firefights. Every combat encounter is so nail-bitingly tense that after some very long sequences, it felt like my heart was going to explode.
The game is also very bleak, with a very dark and violent outlook on this world. It's centered on, moreso than any other video game, the horrors of an apocalyptic world and a poisonous cycle of revenge and hate. If you aren't prepared for that, I can see why someone would come away from the game feeling upset, unfulfilled, and probably depressed.
But, the experience is just unlike anything I've had in a video game. The motion capture, animation, and acting seriously runs circles around any other game in history and the engrossing, beautiful and horrible environments are still top notch.
People can go ahead and call it trash (likely for no other reason than they disagree with some of the game's character choices), but for me it'll go down as one of the best gaming experiences in history.",0.6361554265022278

comments discussing gameplay experience,"The game definitely had some pacing issues
And marketing it as Ellies Story and then playing so much as Abby is a very real flaw that I think kicks the game in at a 9/10 TOPS
But reading through all these top comments, and tone and language they use, seems like people are just ragging on the game because they dont like that Joel died.
And since that's too obvious of a 'salty' opinion they are blowing other minor flaws out of proportion
Joel's death was fine. A little tropey and expected, buy what isn't tropey...? It makes sense that the daughter of the doctor Joel killed would want revenge - and having been a hopeful firefly who lost her pack, she had nothing to lose.
My main issue with playing as Abby, after getting past the issue of the game being billed as Ellies Journey, is the same issue I had with the first games Winter segment
You spend all game building up your character with upgrades and loot, just for it to be taken away - and when you finally return to that character, you only have a handful of encounters left before the game is over.
Ultimately, gameplay should be king when discussing a video game, even one that sets out to be a movie quality narrative. Anyone rating this well made game under an 8, or acting like some 10s are unwarranted while games like MGSV and BotW got tons of 10s from the industry, are just salty kids who like to hate on popular stuff - and reading through peoples reasonings, I'd wager didnt even play the game themselves but are basing their opinions of leaks and the opinions of others.",0.6669604778289795

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Can... can I say that I really enjoyed it? Is that allowed on Reddit?
Can I add that I really liked the limited open-world design decisions, and that I didn't think the controversial scenes were ""riddled with plot holes"" like the Internet wants me to believe?
Can I even go so far as to say that I liked the protagonist switch 15 hours in, and that it didn't ""destroy the game's legacy and undo everything TLOU stood for"" like a very angry DM I got an hour ago told me it did?
Is ""TLOU 2"" perfect? No. But it's certainly not a 0 out of 10.
Also, this idea that it was ""out of character"" for Joel to get ambushed by Abby and her cohorts is so obviously parroted by people who only watched the leaked cut-scenes, it's infuriating. In the actual gameplay, Abby saves Joel's life multiple times, and vice versa. An element of trust was clearly established.
Plus, Tommy and Joel are in the middle of a blizzard, taking shelter. Yes, it's with people they just met, but they trusted Abby. And before you say ""Joel would never do that"" he literally did that with Sam and Henry in the first game.
To hear the Internet tell it, Joel just strolled up to the gates of an armed compound full of strangers and shouted ""Doot doot doo -- I'm Joel. Oh, no -- is that a girl with golf club??"" In actuality, Joel immediately realized he was in a bad situation, but got surrounded by TEN fucking people.
Yes, he gave his name, but Abby already knew who he was, because Tommy told her during the aforementioned infected fight. Also, again -- Joel trusted Abby because she saved his life. She only learned who Joel was from Tommy after it was too later to do anything about it. That's when she hatched the plan to lure him back to the compound, after previously gaining his trust (inadvertently).
Also, Joel isn't fucking superman. He's a haunted by what he's done, and the game goes out its way to show that he's acting irrational about it: the fight at the bar, wandering into a blizzard, a million other flashbacks, etc. Plus, in the first scene, he's got a guitar conspicuously hanging where his rifle hung the entirety of the original game -- same position, same angle. If there's a less subtle way of indicating he's lost his edge that isn't some character saying outright, ""Golly Gee, Joel -- you've certainly lost your mistrust of strangers living around all these good people in Jackson,"" I'd LOVE to hear it!
Finally, the sheer amout of butthurt over Abby being the one to kill Joel is astounding. She's clearly a capable fighter. She's the first player character to kill infected, and she saves Joel's ass by bludgeoning a dozen fungal zombies with a crowbar.

I am bit perplexed at people saying the gameplay is, ""exactly how it was in TLOU."" They must not have played the 1st game recently because not only is the combat piss easy (infected did not use echolocation), it's extremely simplistic and even clunky at times. I loved the many options this entry brings and honestly felt almost MGS-like in some sequences.
I think the story as a whole needed to be completely restructured. It would make the game so much better to deal with, and actually improve the narrative overall had it been done. A lot of things seem really forced because of it when it didn't really need to be so. They really wanted the prologue to be just as shocking as the first game's but I really felt like it was not necessary. I don't see why they couldn't let that happen a couple of hours into the game. Restricting this would've helped this game a lot but at the end of the day, I really felt like the story sucked compared to 1, and rate the story alone a 6/10 at best.",0.6158457398414612

Ellie never murdered a innocent ( pregnant ) women ( or a innocent little puppy ) in cold blood in the game. Watch again. And she stopped searching for Abby after the events in the Aquarium...because she finally snapped out of it, was ready to go home.

Anyway, I'm will never touch a game from Druckmann again. I said that after TLoU already but this time it's real.
That experience was like a movie ( I saw the Devil comes to mind ) with a hypnotic story...but you never want to watch again.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Fantastic write up!
As someone who's seen the game played all the way through I think it's a decent game with some noticeable issues (none of which are the existence of lgbt people, brown people, or women who dare to have biceps). Certainly not 10/10 material but not a dumpster fire like band-wagoners would have you believe either.
It's unfortunate that the review bombing and transphobia/homophobia (seriously, don't go to /thelastofus2. the rampant hatred spewed at minorities is ridiculous) make having genuine discussions about the game's actual issues difficult. Especially in regards to the irl poor treatment of employees at naughty dog.
On top of crunch I've heard from several different people that the developers were made to use actual images/videos of mutilated bodies as reference in the pursuit of realism with the game's violence (though I can't provide concrete sources for the rumors). Regardless, as tech increasingly approaches more realistic depictions I think this will become a more urgent problem in the gaming industry, with people having to embrace subject matter than can inflict real world harm to the psyche in pursuit of art or a paycheck.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"this IS the same whiskeytango! That's so incredibly touching of you to say.
I agree wholeheartedly with your whole post. The show is really leaning into them being just teens, and I think that feels like a misunderstanding of the world of the game. In the game, sure, they are the dictionary definition of teenagers, but they are adults. Young adults sure, but still adults. They have both been through so much in their time. Dina was 10 when she first killed, Ellie 14, and they've done a lot of it since. They exist in a world where, even within the safety of Jackson, they do not get to be teens like people right now do. They are a step away from being child soldiers, being out on patrol to protect the town from the time they're at least 16, but probably younger going by how quickly Ellie writes about trying to get on group patrol.
All of that to say, because they feel more adult, their relationship also feels more adult. There's a feeling of far higher stakes and intimacy than of a teenage crush. For some reason, I imagine maybe because Mazin has kids around their age, that they're now being written like they're kids, kids from our time period and circumstances, and man... it's deflating to the weight of their characters.
Actually honored to read your words again.
That's crazy nice of you to say. I don't want this to turn into me doing a ton of self-advertising, but I do want to say that since I haven't written anything but those two fics, i've decided that I want them to be the best they possibly can be, so in the last couple months I've been working with a professional editor friend of mine to do kind of a ""remastered"" version of them. Been adding new chapters, punching up the writing, and just trying to overall heighten them. I suspect I'll be done with it in the next couple months, and then am going to update the stories on ao3, so i guess just watch that space.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Long comment and late reply, but the idea I was trying to get across is that Joel was acting from understandable human instinct. The fireflies ARE acting like tuskegee experimenters and other medical research atrocities — the doctors were acting from desperation to prevent horrific disease.  
It is the writers creating these moral questions, Joel is only a character. The writers chastised his choice publicly using the torture / bomb logic. They create a sort of facsimile of moral ambiguity; they treat Joel as in the wrong and an instigator of blood feud. They equalize the fireflies. It doesn’t matter that Ellie semi consented — women today have a baby in the hospital and consent to that treatment then get surprise gyno exams while knocked out. Consent is either informed or not actually consent at all. Ellie kills hundreds, gets to Abby, stops. Another boring gaming trope.
I just find the writing frustrating. The characters are charismatic, but the central thesis of the plot fails.

No ones should unless you’re one of those people who think players are better off just not saying anything if they have criticisms (unless your criticism is “Abby is too manly” in which case maybe you should be quiet).",0.6238462328910828
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Most dedicated stealth games also have non-stealth options though? The whole thing is the multiple choices plus my initial comment was a reply about gameplay in third person shooter/stealth games so I wrote it in that context.
The gameplay is serviceable as I said, there's nothing wrong with it. It does the job of being a vehicle to move along the story in these playable movie games that Naughty Dog popularised but it's nothing more than that to me.",0.6028451323509216
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I agree with some of your points, though not all. Especially the gameplay is very enjoyable to me (even though I don’t like horror). But I still believe that the story would work way better if the game were structured differently or simply a movie. And that’s mostly due to the fact that most players will take some breaks, maybe play something else for a few days, etc. and simply in general not finish the game in 1-2 weeks. And IMO in that case many of the nuisances and story details get easily lost. Many players won’t remember most of Ellie’s motivation during day 1, when playing Abbie’s Day 1 or 2.
Also, I have issues with the differences and gaps between gameplay and the rest of the story. Both Abby and Ellie kill hundreds, it’s not easy to stay sympathetic to their motivations. At times it feels like to me Neil/ND didn’t want to do a videogame and are mostly interested in story-telling.
And 100% agree, the scenes with Mel (?) being extremely pregnant and climbing/jumping around are completely crazy. And that’s just bad writing imo.",0.6043971180915833

You have to excuse us for saying that when people still fundamentally fail to grasp the most basic concepts of this game. When someone argues that Joel did nothing wrong to Abby, how on Earth am I meant to take that seriously. That is such a braindead take, it's like arguing that Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds is just really good at his job. How do you even engage with such a surface-level understanding of a narrative?

That really is the long and short of why you'll never get a good convo about this game on Reddit. It's 100% a culture war thing. Its stupid. You'll get a few people you can get some comments for, but mostly you'll get downvoted and dogpiled. It was even worse when the game was still relatively new.

I also want to stress that, while I agree with you (to an extent), I never said that Abby's overall ""hatred"" didn't also come from other experiences too. Okay? I was talking SPECIFICALLY about the Abby-Ellie relationship, and THAT hatred. You're adding more to this conversation than I was even talking about. Furthermore, these characters were written and designed to be extremely complex. It would be a discredit to the forethought of the designers and writers to disregard the fact that the game has a lot of symbolism throughout, and appearances, to an extent, have been part of that. It's undeniable. Experiences physically change us, and I love that they decided to showcase these experiences. If you don't, that's totally fine.

As I gained more responsibilities and with the walkthrough-era of YouTube long extinct, I never got the chance to see much gameplay from the second game. Part 1 coming to PC was a blessing, and got me so hyped to experience part 2.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"It's my favorite example of art not giving you what you want, but what you deserve. This was a singular gaming experience because it took me on the full range of emotions:
Excitement to see Ellie and Joel together. Disappointment and concern. Heartbreak. Rage
My god, the first time you get to Seattle and start killing WLFs felt satisfying. I remember standing UP from the couch when Ellie finally got Nora in her sights. Genuinely electric.
Then the basement. And the theater. And the POV change.
My god. The absolute balls to do that. Then the slow climb up thru there. Seeing the effects of Ellie stalking thru Seattle second hand. Lev and Yara.
And then the theater. Again.
I genuinely thought the farm was the end (at first). Tommy came and my heart dropped. I knew what was coming but I couldn't believe it when they started walking to the boats together. Had to put the controller down when Ellie threatened Lev. Truly her darkest moment....
And then the porch. Fucking in-cred-i-ble move, recontextualizing the entire game. Ellie's rage isn't just for Abby, she's externalized her own self-loathing. The game ""promises"" a revenge quest, but it gives you so much more.
tl;dr No other game made me feel with the characters so well, only to make me feel for them as I watch them make decisions that I know are bad for them. You could not do this story with fresh characters. Only killing someone people have loved (and in some cases had a parasocial relationship with) for years would trigger the same emotional reaction.",0.6003701090812683

I never thought about it but I agree choosing marlene over the surgeon to derive the character of Abby’s background would’ve at least made me relate more as well. But again, your point about Joel ascending back to humanity just makes anyone who wanted to side with the surgeon less relatable. And Especially their random daughter. Like the whole point of the final decision in the first one was so incredible, it doesn’t make sense to punish him, (and destroy all that character development) as the basis for the next plot.
I wish they didn’t go for the mustache twirling villainous plot line. They could’ve just road horses, and talked about giraffes for 20 hours of gameplay as long as it was Elly and Joel growing with the same great commentary. Lol.
In a sea of pretty meh zombie storylines, you get TLOU and see the potential of amazing storytelling, only to be let a bit down with the sequel. It is the best still.

The game was indefinitely delayed, until the leaks came out, obviously by someone who really wanted to hurt Sony and Naughty Dog.
Youtubers that talked about the spoilers were copystriked by a company on behalf of Sony, 2 and 3 times arguing the content was theirs, with the intention to cancel the channel. If you go and put videos of the leaks, then they are right. But discussing spoilers is an abuse of the copyright system that made a Streissand effect. This is also true, look it up.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"damn this is the BORU of all BORUs where most of the comment section seemed to be split clearly into half. there's no ""eh they were both kinda mean"", all i see is TEAM OOP or TEAM GF
i kinda think they both went about this wrongly, but ultimately are just incompatible. as one of the 2 ""professional artists"" of the family, it is both frustrating to:
1) be asked to critique something when i'm off work, and i have no clue how to approach the situation since i dont know how honest i can be. will ask if its okay to be brutally honest then buy them a drink or something
2) BUT also not getting honest feedback from a fellow artist family member because art is subjective and they are also a professional. the more i look at my shit the more i have no fucking clue if this shit looks good or nah, same with music, and sometimes a fresh pair of eyes and ears can help figure it out
so i genuinely see both sides. i think people are really jumping the bandwagon on the ""context clues that gf clearly didnt wanna critique it"" because all OOP said was that she says its great and he's crazy for thinking there's more to it, and thats what OOP had an issue with. maybe i missed something but it feels like a lot of team gfs are pulling subtext out of thin air lmao. but then OOP also.... man it may be better to just try talking to her again, and if it continues, recognise the incompatibility than do this petty shit",0.6036192774772644

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I don’t usually comment, but I hadn’t seen this perspective yet so wanted to bring it up.
I have a little clay frog that my friend made for me. People have told me this frog it ugly, not well done, hardly looks like a frog, and VERY tacky. But I love it! I consider it “good” art! Probably because my friend made it for me and I love her! I may have rose-colored glasses on BECAUSE she is my friend and I love her, but I can’t imagine critiquing it because of my positive feelings for my friend! It doesn’t even occur in my brain to consider “bad” things about it.
Having had an ex who also produced music that was not a genre I liked, knowing it was his made me like it and regard it as good— likely solely because of my care for him. My mind didn’t suggest bad things because I don’t assess art done by people I love in that way; to me it is a piece of their soul and I only see the positive. I couldn’t have critiqued his music knowing it’s his, despite my music theory and performance background.
I think there is a solid chance that this is how this guy’s gf felt. Could also definitely be projecting hahahaha
But yeah otherwise, I agree with everyone else here. They aren’t compatible. He seems unable to take criticism and that probably heavily contributed to her unwillingness to offer critique. Honestly he seems like quite an insufferable person. I’d have Jo interest in ever being around a person who played a trapping-me game like that; to me that is far more fundamentally dishonest than giving “placating” answers when asked to assess a loved one’s art.",0.6257110834121704
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Maybe I’m an asshole but OP wasn’t manipulative, his GF was. Repeatedly lying about what she thought about his music was manipulative. Everyone saying she told him she didn’t want to critique his music is purposely obtuse or failed reading comprehension.

It’s doing exactly what OP was complaining she was doing, placating him simply because she wasn’t mature enough or was too scared to be honest with him. If she had just been honest like he kept asking her to be, he wouldn’t have had to “trick” her into listening to some old song of his.
If OP was a woman complaining that her male partner wasn’t showing interest in her hobby/art & wouldn’t by give honest feedback, these comments would not keep the same energy. Comments very much give yall are mad that a man had the audacity to seek criticism from his woman partner. How dare he burden her with the weight of wanting honest feedback on his art/work. Like be forreal. She even admitted herself she never liked his music but only once shit escalated to a point and couldn’t lie her way out of. It’s been 7 years.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I saw this post floating around Facebook and I created a Reddit account to come comment. 
Give yourself some grace! This is NOT a normal parenting experience. You're doing everything you can, given the circumstances! What Lia is experiencing mentally, is PTSD. A lot of people throw around that label a little to liberally, or reserve it only for combat veterans, but any valid psychiatrist would be able to recognize it from a mile away. PTSD is complex, and not simple to ""treat"". There's not really any medication or set amount of therapy to treat it. As a veteran myself struggling with it, I found traditional therapy VERY triggering - bringing up old memories to discuss how it made me feel and then doing some BS visualization exercise as if that fixed everything, was frustrating. No offense to any therapists here, but doing CBT were a joke to me. 50 minutes to spill the worst experience of your life to a random stranger, just for them to throw some psychology words at you, tell you ""it's not your fault"" and then ""wrap it up"" by breathing in 4 counts and out - yeah, not my cup of tea. 
As you probably already know from other commenters, I would not admit your daughter into a psychiatric hospital. They are pretty notorious for being awful places, and having her in a situation where she cannot freely access you, surrounded by men, where people have to watch her undress, in a place where she can't escape - it's just asking her to relive the experience. It's okay that you weren't aware of this, as these places are SUPPOSED to be helpful - but they're not. They medicate you and watch you like an animal in a cage. 
I can't tell you what for certain would help, because this truly is a difficult situation, but maybe look at alternative therapy. I attended an Equine Therapy Retreat for my PTSD, and it gave me moments of peace, and a purpose. There were women that attended with me, who had horrendous stories of assaults that happened to them while serving, some of the stories made me sick to my stomach. While you never shake the scar of the event that traumatized you, everyone I attended with left feeling a weight off their shoulders. It didn't ""heal"" everything, but it defogged our vision enough to keep going. One guy, who had previously OD'd just two weeks before, went on to publish a book he always dreamed of working on. 
Can't promise it would work for your daughter, but it definitely would be better than a psychiatric unit. 
Best of luck to you and your daughter. I am so sorry this is happening. Hopefully the days get a little bit easier, but just know you're doing everything you can. ",0.6057620644569397

While gameplay is subjective, I found OP's attempts at calling the gameplay of especially TLOU2 uninnovative and the likes. I personally found the fluidity of TLOU2's gameplay and grittiness of it to be exceptionally brutal and ""enjoyable""(I felt uncomfortable at times, especially in certain significant fights, but it was enjoyable in the manner that I could not put the controller down). What I found incredibly genius about it that only caught on in later playthroughs is just how much the gameplay is tied into the story. The story and the gameplay evolve together. The environments, puzzles, music, and enemies faced reflect the mood of what's going on in the game as the plot progressively evolves.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Hands down one of the most complete, well-thought out analysis I've seen around. Goes to great lengths to dissect most of the issues in a fair and informative manner, while exuding a passion for the game and attention for details second to none.
Particularly enjoyed how you worded out the meaning behind the ending, the flashbacks merely seen as emotional anchors not to lose the player and Listen Mode... oddly enough, I apply the same critique to the gameplay: imho TLoU's original gameplay felt more natural and grounded and so more fitting to the world and suitable to my liking, even though it's simpler and average.

Indeed it helps, but it still takes a lot of dedication to go over it in such a structured way!

comments discussing gameplay experience,"""Also from what is suggested about Jackson they seem to take on new recruits and members to their community. We also know they would take in visitors as Joel explains that he traded some of his belongings for coffee at the end of the game""
Stuff like this is basically the whole reason why theres just ""game of this generation"" and ""the worst trash of this generation"" people. Like you can completely take every little piece and many times use your imagination/interpretation to say ""no no, this is because this and that"" and say that those who dont do that are just to dumb, ignorant or even just resent the game because theyre bigots/homophobes. Or you can just see what actually happened on screen, like what actually was and is and judge it by that.
Id say though that the necessity to piece stuff together or even interpret and imagine things to a story or game is a bad thing. For example, I recently red a comment on the Morpheus vs Neo fight scene in the Matrix, which said that the sparring program was designed so that Morpheus wins, so Neo landing a hit was already the sign that he is the chosen one. Because he broke the rules of the world he was in.
Now the thing is, this is just interpretation, which imo makes the scene even better, but, it is not necessary, the scene just worked perfectly. But if something is in question, and you need to interprete and piece stuff together to make it work flawlessly, its flawed.",0.6171478033065796
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I agree with a lot of this. I loved the representation in the game. If someone is offended by it even though it isn't a part of the story and doesn't detract from it, then they are jerks. And Abby's body is certainly possible even in that world in 4 years although extremely unlikely, but given the greater than life characters it's excusable. And the whole ""vaccine for a fungus doesn't work"" thing is silly because it was just a ""cure"" and you're supposed to believe it.
My gripe is that the fireflies were shown as incompetent and as terrorists but the second game retconned that and made them seem good. Think of how they beat Joel when breathing Ellie back in Salt Lake City. And how disgusting the room was and how angry Jerry looked. I personally always shot him in the foot which shouldn't have killed him (and doens't even register as a kill in the stats apparently) yet the game retcons that gameplay decision as well. I would sneak past all the guards yet Pt2's intro shows a bunch of dead bodies. The first game's ending was morally ambigious but the ONLY way fireflies are shown in part 2 are as good guys.
I do agree Ellie being different in the game is okay because she's on a downward spiral and also growing up as a teen, especially with the Joel context (both his death and the Fireflies thing). The way they handled their relationship was perfect in my opinion.
But overall, i think the problem was that they used the story to tell messages about not judging people, perspective and empathy, and forgiveness and acceptance rather than telling a cohesive story. The disorienting flashback structure, the emotional fatigue and self-indulging misery and violence with zero payoff or saving grace were just too much. I still think the whole experience was engaging and would give the game an 8, which is a far cry from the 10 I'd give the first.
And the big lies that Ellie is the only playable character and no killing dogs and Joel being there were dismissable in isolation, but together, they make it clear that ND was afraid to tell this story because they wanted to use nostalgia from the old game and a vision of a game that never existed to market it, which is and will always be dishonorable. I do think the leaks were unfortuante as they shaped a lot of people's expectations already. Fortunately I didn't know anything yet I don't love the game either.
Lastly, the way ND and its actors and employees are hiding behind smokescreens and using silly awards like ""most completed game"" and extremely misleading statistics and putting themselves above others as morally and intellectually refined people who are able to understand the deep profundity of this masterpiece and bashing everyone who disagrees with intellectual dishonesty doesn't sit right. If I were an official at Sony, I'd never let this kind of thing happen because the damage control act and coverups are admissions of failure.",0.6322796940803528
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Pretty much my experience. Like, I could've written that myself including the Hillcrest part.
Pacing of the game is part of why people were ""depleted"" at the end but that has been discussed before so I just tried to stay on my specific point. I think the fact that the game is beautiful, and the cinematic gameplay is attractive makes some people not pay attention to the story itself. We have to be objective, we all don't have the same ""priorities"", for me storytelling in this game is my number 1 priority, graphics and gameplay come in a clear second place. Butchering the story and characters that I care about can't be compensated with nicer graphics and gameplay. What NC tried to push as a ""revolutionizing"" story h driven games and pushing boundaries was nothing but an amateurish push for moral lectures. I remember a verse from an old song that goes something like ""if someone steals but then sacrifices himself (like in, sacrifices his life to save others), what should we do?"" And I can hear NC in the back, ""stealing is wrong!""
NC tried to ""push"" way too many boundaries, from both technical and moral points of view and the result was a beautiful but chaotic mess. If he had picked one maybe, just maybe, it would've been a different story (pun intended!)

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Another top level comment bc I can't stop myself and it looks like you don't want me to: I was very new to video games when I played DAI, despite being an older nerd. I played my first modern video game during quarantine, when my roommate held my hand and walked me thru Horizon Zero Dawn. So, after I loved it, and played it a couple times, the sequel had just come out - so I played Horizon Forbidden West and I also loved it. I didn't know I was getting a new hobby, but then she showed me how to play Dragon Age Inquisition and wow I was hooked. For me, it was so great having someone around who new about the first two games so I could just ask her about the history of the world and she just knew it, like it was real. I played a brunette human warrior because I am not very good at video games and it seemed like the easiest thing I could button mash my way through. I couldn't believe how big the maps were! And I knew there were different outcomes depending on what I did or said, but I didn't look up the alternatives. I just made the decisions for my character and let the pieces fall where they may. I romanced Blackwall the first play through, and the shock I felt when he left Skyhold the night after we slept together! The romance in the game wasn't something I knew about before hand, but I really came to care about it. I played again, as a male dwarf and romanced Cassandra, and boy was that hard! Flowers, poetry, the works! But that's also my experience in life as a bisexual. You do hafta put more work in for the ladies. Well, I do anyways.
So, I waited a while to play Veilguard. I knew everyone else had like 10 years in between games, so I took my time. I played Dragon Age 2, the one on the Xbox with Hawke, and it was interesting, but I didn't make it all the way through. Busy with life, etc. Like 6 months ago I saw a used copy of DAV in gamestop for like $16 so I bought it. I made sure I felt like I was finished with Inquisition, and I started Veilguard with tempered expectations but a lot of hope. It was very shiny, very pretyy, and the hair made my character look like a Disney princess, which I kind of liked, but it felt a little out of place in Thedas. Nevermind, I said. Its just character design. I was excited to see Scout Harding, devastated when Varric got hurt, but I soldiered on. I was Rook, a spunky Veil Jumper, who restarted that section of the game because I didn't know everyone else in that faction had face tattoos, so I went a got some. So I would fit in. I'm trying to enjoy this game on its own terms, but every time I go to talk to a companion at the Lighthouse, Bellara is there, already chatting them up. Why do I feel competitive with one of my own companions? Is it a mechanic of the game? No. Its just fucking weird. So, I don't want to romance anyone because it feels awkward, on top of that, everyone talks like a YA character at the beginning of the book. Which is fine for people who like that, I think, but I don't read YA books. I watched my partner play BG3, I saw the crazy sexual energy everyone was flinging around that game, and I don't want that either. I am not a prude person, but the romance in Dragon Age is more a cherry on top situation for me. But it felt like that's all the writers of the game cared about. This write up about the development hell illuminates a lot for me, and it really feels like it was given to younger writers who had only written fanfic up until that point.
I say to myself, I'm just gonna focus on the main quest. I won't try to make friends, I'll just solve this Solas thing and put him to rest once and for all. I picked up the controller again, i forget what point it was at, but the game basically said, 'if you want to progress the story, you need to do companion side quests now.' Like, could there be a clearer sign that its not for me? I like the look of it, I like the mechanics enough. Maybe I'll try again in like a year. For the meantime I purchased Mass Effect legendary edition for like $20 and I have made it thru two of those games so far. I started ME3 last night. Its going REALLY well, but they are super hard. Even on easy mode, I still had to really try.
I also restarted DAI with a new character. I love reading all these comments and hearing everyone else's experiences. It is better to suffer together.",0.6211273074150085

In all seriousness, it sounds like you're still committed to this game, so assuming you don't want to quit despite that this story does raise a few red flags for myself and other commentors: A couple options would be to not have her come back as a PC at all and tell the DM you won't be playing the character and that she can be an NPC under his control.
Wth the terrible time in the woods she had, whatever that NPC might have done to punish her family is really not her fault and portraying it that way won't have the dramatic effect your DM might intend. She basically was given zero agency over her own fate, so it would be one thing if she got to live her own life and control her destiny but he kind of ruined that setup with going heavy on the edgy kidnapped in the woods thing.

If you didn’t like the gameplay itself that’s fine. But I think it’s silly to say you expected a better story when you just wanted a story that ties up neatly, when TLOUP2 is intentionally messy and supposed to leave you feeling dissatisfied.
Like that’s the whole point of the game, as a work of art. You’re supposed to feel uncomfortable. You’re supposed to grapple with the fact that you no longer like or relate to a character you loved.

Ellie completely lost herself and I think it’s to the game’s credit that she lost me too.

I personally like to feel uncomfortable sometimes with stories. Kind of like watching a horror movie. I of course hated seeing Joel be killed gruesomely. I hated feeling like Ellie was turning into the bad guy very quickly. But those things made me feel something deeply in a way not many games do. I get the sense, not necessarily from you, but from other people that hated the game, that they don’t like to feel sad or mad about something that happens in a story. (Pertaining specifically to critiques of story, not gameplay)
I really liked how they made two factions (Ellie and Dina vs. WLF and Abby’s friends) that were harder than usual to decide how I felt about who was more moral, without it just being two factions that suck (Skyrim’s empire and storm cloaks).

I know that probably makes me a dick, but I can’t stand people who do this much damage to themselves with no reason to, and then get sympathy. We as a society are failing for not shaming people like that from being fucking idiots.
She also did not pursue her ex for child support cause he said it was either that or being in her child’s life.

Abusive relationships? I get that. Brain does funny things because of stress, makes you trauma bond to your own abuser, crazy stuff but totally understandable.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Yikes, this thread represents exactly what I hate about the discourse surrounding this game. It’s either the best game ever, a true artistic masterpiece or the worst piece of garbage ever made.
In my opinion it’s neither. Technically the game is top notch. Obviously the graphics are fantastic. The gameplay builds on what Part 1 did well and makes it better. It’s really well acted and the moment to moment writing is pretty good.
But the game suffers from its pacing. Cutting to a ~10 hour playable flashback in the middle of what seemed to be the climax of the game is a really bold choice. I understand what they were trying to do and I appreciate that they were willing to take risks, but it just throws everything off. (And it’s something I was really hoping the show would attempt to fix.) Then we return to climax and it’s not even the end of game.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"There are some things i really like about it, like the enemy AI, fighting Tommy and Ellie was really cool, the savageness of it, but it did have some flaws.
Going from day 3 back to day 1 was a big turnoff. I feel if they switched characters throughout the whole game, it would've been more engaging and impactful. You also would've cared a lot more about killing Owen and the dog as Ellie. Would've been so shocking.
I also agree with the general sentiment that, Tommy and Joel introducing themselves like that was stupid and out of character. Also Ellie went idiotic on the last leg. I didn't buy her doing all that. But it's fiction, they can do whatever they want.
I get that it may not be for everyone, cause it is quite miserable. A friend of mine had to stop playing cause it was too much for her.

You really feel each character's story and you go through similar emotions that they express as the game progresses. That's the beauty of this game.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Games can be tricky to score, I feel like people take things a little too seriously and harass people for giving a game less than an 8/10. The culture can be very toxic.
Also ign gave one of my favourite childhood games a 4.9/10. Which is funny because the user score today is 9.1/10. But I can't blame a single person for rating a game that low because maybe they just didn't find the gameplay appealing at all?
Game enjoyment is subjective. Just because I love Elden Ring, doesn't mean the average person will. At the end of the day a rating doesn't tell us much.
Also, be the change you want to see in the world, rate that game a 5/10! or a 2/5, 3/7, who cares shit's made up",0.611152708530426
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Agreed.
There’s also the fact that as your read a review or criticism of something, you are placing importance on certain aspects of the review. For example, perhaps you prefer gameplay over story, or art direction over controls. 
So any mention of those particular elements kind of sways your ‘final score’ in a given direction. But the author has their own elements they feel most influenced their score. 
I feel like the final score is even more subjective than the (already subjective) written review. I’d rather just read a well written review and glean from it my own interpretation of a final score.

The section on gameplay is so barebones they might as well not include it in the review.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I read a couple medium score reviews from rpgsite, Dualshockers and monstervine and they still have a very good view toward the game despite the lower scores. Dualshockers mentioned that it's repetitive, but this is also after you have done a bunch of run and familiar with the core gameplay. Interestingly, the same review mentioned about how the boss you meet through the run are undertuned and the final boss is overtuned, I believe this is due to level of players being under or overpowered. I also think that's because the reviewers and his friends are familiar with Soul genre, so they may pick up things fast. There's mention of playing with strangers are serviceable, so this could be that it's gonna be bloody easy or it's gonna be bloody hard.
They all appeared to agreed that single player is not the way to play given the number of enemies are not scaled down.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"<sarcasm> I'm glad that was a honest reaction. There's been so many dishonest ones with people lying about what their opinions are. </sarcasm>
The complaints in the 1:1 comparisons are precisely why so many changes were made. It's not about which delivery was better. You're already familiar with the game's scenes. It's what you know and expect, so in any scenes that copy the game, you're going to see any deviations as something wrong.
All of us who have played the game are looking at it with that bias. It will be interesting to see people who first saw the story in the show play the game and see if they feel the game or the show was superior in those scenes. I'd bet they prefer the show's versions since it will be what they already know.
My own opinion is that gameplay will tend to involve people more. You're not watching Joel and Ellie. You ARE Joel (or Ellie) and you're experiencing their journey first hand and not just a spectator. That will change your perspective. The important thing is the show allows an entirely new audience who isn't into video games to fall in love with the same story we've fallen in love with over and over.",0.6341003775596619
comments discussing gameplay experience,"This is very interesting and at points compelling—until the point where you compare game scenes and show scenes 1:1 and declare how each feels. ""That's just, like, your opinion, man,"" and I think you're letting your original experience of the game tint your view of each.
I loved the games, but clearly it didn't hit me nearly as hard as it hit a lot of people in this sub. I don't find myself having such strong reactions to one line here or there as I see in this sub, and I think that's OK—it's cool to see people waiting to see certain things that I'd completely forgotten happened—but I also think that those things stick with you because they hit you a certain way at a certain time in your life and you can never replicate that, and while it's great that art does that for people, it's not really a great way to compare things because it's so distinct for every person.
I loved the show, too. I do think there were things they could've done better, and I think simply by nature of immersing yourself in a game for many, many times longer, you're obviously likely to get some more feeling of growth and attachment than the show would ever have been able to portray. I think they did a really good job, but nothing's perfect and there's always room for improvement that's worth discussing.
I think a lot of people liked the games as action games, and so a lack of infected in the show was disappointing to them like it wasn't to me (as I age, I actually want less action in my media—it tends to be the least-interesting thing on screen, for me), but I also think the criticism that the infected were too sparse is fair—they are, after all, the reason Ellie needed protection, and the whole reason for the journey at all.
I think that's my biggest agreement with the criticism I've heard. The other stuff really just feels to me like someone who placed the games in a very special place in their heart, and nothing will ever take that away, and that's great, but it's not a particularly level-headed analysis of the adaptation.",0.6339215040206909

Based on a lot of the comments I’ve read here, it really does feel a bit split on which medium executed it better. Ig it’s just personal preference. But bruh I just love the game’s so much more. The music not being loud in the show peeves me off a bit more than it should",0.6671444773674011
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I don’t disagree with much of anything you said, my two cents is just that games have a lot of, how do I say this…
When a gamer plays a game, the gameplay is the point and story is fluff.
On TV it’s flipped. I would have enjoyed seeing more infected fights, but that’s gameplay. It’s fluff on TV. It’s why most people don’t like watching others play a game. We’d rather be playing ourselves instead of watching.
Meanwhile, in the game, there’s so much gameplay that there’s tons of places to insert fluff(story) to build characters over a lengthy (much longer than a show) period of time.
So of course the game hits harder. And the show could / should have had a few more episodes. To their credit, though, the show cut nearly all the fluff(gameplay).",0.6083462238311768
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I played the game for the first time just before starting to watch the show. In my opinion, I thought certain scenes hit harder in the show than the game. But part of that is that it took me well into the game to start enjoying the gameplay. I was playing for the story primarily. Maybe it’s just that the gameplay is starting to show its age, but it felt clunky and unresponsive, and it was difficult for me to look past it. So watching the show without that added frustration let me just enjoy the story and the character development.
All that said, I do agree that there probably should have been more time dedicated to fleshing out their relationship in the show (and honestly more infected.) I wouldn’t say their scenes felt unearned to me, but I had the context of the game influencing how I was seeing the show. I think the show was exceedingly well done, though slightly flawed.",0.6086832880973816

comments discussing gameplay experience,"You're certainly free to experience it as you did, but I disagree about the 1:1 comparisons. I think there were a lot of scenes where the show felt more emotionally poignant.
I do prefer the game's version of the farmhouse dialogue, mostly because of Ashley Johnson's delivery of the ""everybody fucking except for you!"" line -- it's like she starts saying ""everybody except for you"" and the curse and the shove are a sudden unintended outburst, while Bella's delivery of the line was just planned that way.

It’s a hard piece of media to adapt, for sure. I’m not sure he’s really tried to adapt the Ellie story in the way I understood it, though. That’s ok. It’s his creative vision.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Completely agree. Every bit of violence in TLOU 1 felt justified; every raider or infected killed in the game was going to kill Joel or Ellie and there was no other choice. You were fighting just to survive.
While the doctors death in Part 1 was rightfully controversial if he was alive the Fireflies would have kept searching for Ellie to kill her so while morally you might not like it there was at least some justification for it in the mind of Joel that you can relate to even if you don't personally agree with. It wasn't a happy ending, no story in this world really could be.
But every single death in TLOU 2 was unnecessary. It is tragic that Abby's father died but all of the people Ellie and Abby kill were unnecessary. I know that was the point but it felt so heavy handed that it robbed the story of all of the nuance and intrigue that the first game had.
And I am annoyed as fuck that legitimate complaints like this about Abby get buried and shoved aside under a literal sea of hate comments about things that don't even matter, like how buff she was.
And this is the big thing. I don't think the story justifies it's existence but if I say I didn't enjoy it I'm an anti-trans bigot.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"This was a very thoughtful post. 
There are two elements that seem to predict how people respond to the game. 
You've identified the first in your post: discomfort. The story is ugly, difficult, emotionally complex and asks the player to sit in feelings that are generally accepted to be 'bad'. It causes us to feel uncomfortable about how easily we can be swept into poor judgement and when faced with discomfort, we can either look within to the cause, or blame outward. For many, media is entertainment meant for comfort, so they feel betrayed by the developers. Part II is art.
The response by u/bakuhatsuda identifies the other: attention. This story demands your focus and to be immersed so that you resist the ego-protecting instinct to 'switch off' and blame the game for making you uncomfortable. The pacing of dialogue and the lingering camera and the haunting score are all in service of lengthening the time we have to weigh our own emotions against what we're experiencing. Without attention, it's impossible to connect and it's particularly bad for people streaming the game who are conditioned to react and interact, rather than to contemplate and respond.
So can you have empathy without being able to 'suffer' discomfort or being able to pay attention to the emotions of others? 
It's interesting that you feel that Korean gaming culture really latched onto hating this game. Forgive me, but as an urban Canadian, my impression is that in a lot of ways Korea can be as extremely hyper capitalist as America. The cutting edge of materialistic/consumerist culture worships comfort and demonizes 'trying too hard' or giving a lot of care an attention to things unrelated to money or 'success'. Given that baseline for a culture, is it surprising that online-forward communities are so reactively hateful toward this game?
I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm glad to hear from another person very far from me that they felt the intense humanity of this experience. You've written about vulnerability and empathy with thoughtfulness and kindness. I hope more people read your post. Thank you",0.6349432468414307
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Thank you very much for your comment, brobrobrob. As you pointed out, in Korea this isn’t just an impression anymore — it’s the reality.
Interestingly, however, when it comes to film, the Korean audience tends to evaluate artistic quality more fairly.
So when I first played this game, I thought opinions might be divided, but that its artistic value would at least be recognized by many gamers.
But within the Korean gaming community, the overall response to this game is overwhelmingly negative.
That includes people who have actually played the game and even those who haven’t.
And as you mentioned, this reflects a broader cultural attitude toward media.
Content that tries to deliver deep emotional or moral messages, in other words, works that focus more on emotional resonance or meaning than on fun, often gets dismissed or mocked.
There’s really no clear solution. Over the past five years, the YouTube ecosystem in Korea has gained enormous influence as a form of mass media.
The opinions of certain streamers or reviewers are often accepted as facts or absolute truths, regardless of their accuracy.
A strong tendency toward collectivism over individual thinking also reinforces this pattern.",0.6013175249099731

comments discussing gameplay experience,"IMO there's an argument to be made that such a message would be better delivered in a less gameplay heavy game (maybe like a Detroit: Become Human or Life is Strange format), which is a view shared by some relatively more thoughtful Youtubers I watched. One guy I watched said he'd rather watch a long cutscene showing Abby's side than have to play the drawn out combat gameplay segments. In my experience, those long drawn out combat segments dissipated my energy and often left me drained when the next cutscene came around.
Sometimes, the drawn out combat segments, especially the hotel descent section, felt like the cruel embodiment of that phrase some people use against people who sympathize with an opposing side, immigrants, enemies, etc.: ""If you like X so much, why don't you live with them (with all the monotony that accompanies it)."" But no, you don't have to live with someone with all the monotonous moments that would accompany it to sympathize with someone. Such an important message as this game needs to be subtle and not overstay its welcome, which long combat gameplay segments can sometimes go against.",0.6160957217216492

I still have no idea how fictional characters can make me feel such strong emotions... goes to show how well-crafted this artful story really is!
Ps. Fu** Abby. 🤣",0.6013153195381165
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I agree so much with your take on the game. It's a masterpiece that makes people feel things in a way most other stories don't (not just games). If there's any artistic justice in the world, games like this will grow to become essential art that gets assigned to high school or college kids like the literary classics of the past. Yeah, I felt negative emotions during this game, but demanding only positive emotions from art is ridiculous. Imagine saying a breakup album is bad because it should have been all happy songs.
I agree that fandom is a problem too, though I'm not sure I agree 100%. It almost feels like your implication is that criticism of a thing by consumers is bad, and only the author can have any valid opinion on what characters would or wouldn't do. I certainly give the author's view precedence over others, but I wouldn't say they're always right by definition. This gets even more complicated when it's a branded thing and the original creator isn't involved. For example, I think the Star Wars prequels are terrible, but you can at least argue that Lucas was involved and the choices carry more weight for that reason. By the time you get to The Last Jedi, the Star Wars brand is really more about selling stuff than telling any kind of story that the creator of it feels must be told.
It seems like the view many fans take is that because something is called X and I identify as a fan of X, the art in question is automatically good if it's labeled as X. I believe this tendency to like anything labeled as X can be worse than the hipster-y tendency to hate things labeled as X because ""I'm a fan of the original X."" It's an especially insidious form of gatekeeping. You see this often in fandoms. ""You're not a real MST3K fan if you don't like Jonah exactly as much as Mike and Joel"" or ""You don't actually like wrestling if you prefer AEW and New Japan over WWE."" (These are admittedly very niche, but I'm sure we've all seen examples of this sort of thing - and maybe been guilty of it ourselves.) No one says those exact words, but they are opinions that can be enforced on a community through actions and implications.
This cuts both ways too. If someone blindly defended this game because ""it's The Last of Us and Neil Druckmann is always right,"" I wouldn't be any more convinced than I am by ""The Last Jedi is brilliant because Star Wars is always right."" Let's argue on the merits. It's always fair to criticize art and, while different people can (and will) come to different views, it's okay to think some art is good and other art is bad. That's how we learn to tell better stories and/or to identify good stories - or, at least, what we believe makes a good story.
I don't think you'd actually disagree with any of that, but I do think there's probably a little bit of space between our views, so hopefully I've articulated it well enough to provide a slightly different perspective.",0.6269163489341736
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I think you articulated yourself quite well! It was definitely an interesting perspective. ☺️
I definitely don’t want to imply that criticism from fans or consumers is a bad thing. I do think art is subjective and everyone’s opinion on the material matters. I agree that the creator’s view does take precedence over fan’s desires, but like you stated, it doesn’t make them right. I’m definitely not in the camp of “Neil Druckmann is always right” as that is definitely another unhealthy extreme.
I guess what I was trying to say is that there’s critiquing art and then there’s complaining about “I expected X to happen and it didn’t so this sucks”. I’ve read several reviews for the game, some who give it a 6/10 or so, and I can definitely see where they are coming from! I think there’s several reviews and valid criticisms from fans of the game, but the ones who take it to the extreme of “We wanted this and you didn’t give it to us, so you suck” are, I feel personally, flooding a lot of the negative reviews of this game.
I hope that makes sense? But like you said, I think we agree for the most part. Fandom is a beautiful thing that can definitely be integrated into the art form in some way, but when pleasing fans takes precedence over story, I begin having an issue with that.",0.6068791151046753

I hope that creators like Neil Druckman and the rest of Naughty Dog’s team continue to take risks like this despite the backlash.

One of my favorite aspects of Part II is the ""click"" that I felt during Joel and Ellie's final conversation about forgiveness, and how it plays into the plot so well. I also felt that the portrayal of Ellie's PTSD was pretty accurate - probably not 100% accurate, but enough that it gets the point across and doesn't under- or overplay it.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"[SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE ENTIRE GAME]
I just finished the game and honestly my opinion is basically this: it’s, at best, an okayish game. Not good, not terrible.
I really think they tried to do something different here with the gameplay and the map being just Lumiose, but it’s not well executed.
The gameplay, while refreshing for the first few hours, quickly becomes plain button mashing. Once you get megas, you barely even have to think about move types, it’s all about throwing out the biggest numbers.
The whole “command your Pokémon” mechanic is really janky and sometimes unbearable. Sometimes they run into walls trying to reach the enemy’s Pokémon, then unleash the move at the wall. Big Pokémon, especially alphas, get stuck on anything, and it happens so often it stops being funny. Other times they’ll run across the stage just to launch a move from far away. Just do the attack already, you don’t need to go to the exact spot!
And that huge delay after switching Pokémon, why? I get that it’s for balancing, but sometimes you have to swap because the other one died. Why does the game think it’s okay for the enemy to land a free hit after I already lost a Pokémon? It just feels poorly thought out.
Talking about the story and characters, why is everyone a “good guy”? There are no real villains here. By the end, basically everyone becomes your friend. Even the guy who’s literally a criminal making shady loans that exploit young girls? Even the X/Y villain became a good guy. That’s too much. Why can’t people just be bad anymore? Is sanitizing every story the new trend so nothing ever gets dramatic? That’s ridiculous.
I actually liked Team MZ, especially Naveen and Lida. They had potential, clear goals, great design, cool vibes. But in the end they’re just side characters with zero development. We never see Lida dancing or Naveen’s fashion stuff go anywhere. They just help in battles (barely) and that’s it, which is sad because their designs are flawless.
AZ, on the other hand, was solid. His death at the end was a great and sad conclusion to his arc, although it’s weird that he left everything to children. Then again, after X/Y, maybe he trusts kids more than adults.
Now, Taunie I hated her. Maybe I’m the only one, but she’s selfish, self-centered, and completely out of touch. She takes a loan from shady people, disappears when it’s time to deal with it, and dumps all the consequences on her friends. She doesn’t even try to help, and when everything’s finally solved by you, she cracks jokes about it. I felt like a dumb rug just there to clean up her mess.
And how is she able to keep up with us in the ZA Royale? Our opponents are brutal, but hers are apparently so easy she gets to Rank A in half a day. Sure. Then there’s the Floette thing: why do we even fight her to earn the right to mega evolve if she’s just going to do it anyway? The game literally gives you a line like “I’ll win for the city’s sake,” and it means nothing. And to top it all off, she fails at what she was supposed to do, wrecks the city center, and forces everyone else to deal with her chaos again. Even Naveen and Lida call her out sometimes, but in the next textbox, they’re clapping for her. This is the worst rival in Pokémon history, not because she’s boring or irrelevant, but because she’s insufferable.
The city looks awful. There’s no other way to put it. Almost no NPCs live there, they just stand still. Nobody enters buildings. It’s wild to think Black & White did this better with Castelia City on the DS. Most buildings have no interiors except for story ones. Even the important ones are small and full of locked doors. Some have signs and detailed exteriors that suggest something cool inside, but they’re just big empty boxes. That’s really what the city is: big boxes with flat textures.
Also, why are the wild zones taking up most of the city by the end? Entire neighborhoods are gone. Are we pretending people can just live next to alpha Pokémon now? The story briefly acknowledges this mid-game, but by the end it’s like “nah, it’s fine.” Everyone lost their homes, jobs, and sense of safety, but we’re supposed to accept giant monsters living next door. Okay.
At the end, you’re given three wish options, but only one actually matters. So why even give me the illusion of choice? It’s so bad I just farted.
And yet, I had so much fun. Despite everything, the Pokémon formula still scratches that itch in my brain from when I was a kid, and this one did too. Even with all the frustration, I still got attached to my team and felt happy when things wrapped up. That’s the curse of being a Pokémon fan, the love isn’t logical.
If you like Pokémon, this one’s worth having in your collection. If you’ve never played the series, don’t bother. It’s not a good game. It’s bland, and at best, it’s just okay.
TL;DR: fun but frustrating. Legends ZA tries new ideas but most of them don’t work. Weak story, bad rival, empty city, janky gameplay. Still somehow enjoyable because, well… it’s Pokémon.",0.6103087067604065

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Crossposting from a comment on /r/television:
I need someone to give me a rundown of what was so good about the writing in this game. I played it once and remember it being fairly rote (til the ending) and perfunctory, nothing about it felt all that complex or inspired.
Where I really thought it shine was in the direction and production. It is a beautiful game with stunning art direction, atmosphere and a fully realised world. Performances were pretty terrific.
But yeah the writing is held up by gamers as being some sort of literary masterpiece, but it's just the same general beats from infinite other post apocalyptic stories, and the characters were incredibly likeable without being all that complex. I honestly barely remember any details about them other than Joel was gruff and Ellie was a kind of resourceful, plucky kid. Are gamers just not that well read or something? I'm so baffled. People acting like this game was written by Shakespeare himself or like Eugene O'Neill or someone.
EDIT: I really gotta expand on this because it's genuinely making me crazy. So, I don't have an English degree. I read a lot, but I'm no Joan Didion. I watch a lot of movies, and I love certain TV shows, particularly shows with richly textured characters like The Sopranos. I recognise good writing when I see it, as many of us do - it's layered, ambiguous, but very specific and truthful, it begins to feel alive after a while, draw you in with things you can relate to and recognise that you otherwise may never have seen. Style is also a factor, and when aiming for something very specific it can all by in the style, like certain scenes or characters in The Sopranos carrying a weight that they wouldn't otherwise if the exact language, phrases and intentions were not accurately portrayed. You BELIEVE in Tony, Christopher, Paulie because you RECOGNISE them, they're real people, they exist. Likewise, the world around them has a pulse, it feels like a self-sustaining organism that exists with or without them. I don't really know if I'm making sense, but what I DO know is that it's probably the greatest written show of all time, though I've never seen the Wire. What I hear, though, is that The Wire is every bit its equal.
I guess what I'm saying is that the more literary, ie. truthful, earnest, ambiguous and yet specific that something like a TV show can be, the more successfully it can dramatise things so minute like pulp in orange juice and use that to build WHOLE LIVES that you come to recognise yourself in... the better the writing, right?
Where on Earth do people get off thinking a kinda awesome zombie game with a likeable duo at the heart of it, killing people with bricks but barely expanding on who they are... is somehow in the upper echelon of works of literary merit? Who truly believes this that aught to know? Anyone? Or is it just fanboys online?
EDIT 2: I also gotta add another little condition of great writing - revelation. The writer actually revealing something they truly believe, have experienced, have gone through, ARE going through that makes the writing that much more pungent and truthful. An honest reflection of internal life as a representation of an external life. Using emotion to fuel imagination and create something real.
Watching The Sopranos with the knowledge that David Chase created it because he ""needed therapy"" and that he based Livia on his mother, you begin to understand why it came out swinging so hard. It really was what he was going through. His NJ upbringing, Tony's struggle to comprehend his own mind, to contend with his demons... it's all a real human being's internal life being dramatised for our enjoyment.
Sam Shepard said ""catharsis is getting rid of something. I'm not trying to get rid of my demons. I want to shake hands with them."" His work is just that - shaking hands with his demons. Some of his darkest thoughts must have gone into his work because he goes to some fucking emotionally harrowing places.
Why do people think Neil Druckmann is some sort of Nobel Laureatte? Even Ann Rice managed to dramatise the loss of a child in her first book and it SHOWS. Where in TLOU has Druckmann told us anything so revealing about himself?

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Excellent comment. I've felt this for a while and partly stopped playing games because of it. Around the time TLOU came out, gaming had gotten weirdly... pretentious, if that's even the right word. Video game ""critics"" wanted to be taken seriously as though they were the next Lester Bangs, or Roger Ebert (two completely authentic and unpretentious dudes) and games themselves all had lofty marketing and really artsy marketing that put forward how ""movie-like"" they were.
Then you played them and they mostly just had this laughably poor ersatz cinema feel. LA Noir was a fun GAME but the interrogation scenes and disconnected story was just a complete simulacrum of James Ellroy written by amateurs who knew nothing about the LAPD that I couldn't find out by googling it. Ellroy literally lost his fucking mother and grew up around those guys, who told him their stories and he wrote it all down. The Black Dahlia is a creepy, psycho-sexual book dedicated to his mother, in fact he calls it her ""valediction,"" because that's the best he could do, he had to contend with this weird, Freudian hole in his heart left by her murder and his own obsession with unsolved crime in Los Angeles.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"TLOU2 has showed how immature the fanbase is
Yesterday i was reading a post saying something like “buying TLOU2 for 9,99 dollars was the worst spending of my life: i should have bought toilet paper instead”. Hundreds of like and comment with the same, old hate to the game.
I mean, come on guys… it’s ok if you don’t like the plot of a game, but this “criticism” is beyond any rationality. It’s nothing new, i mean: since the beginning, this game has received A LOT of immotivated hate, simply because of a plot decision (Joel’s death).
This game is by far one of the best of all time, not only for its amazing gameplay and graphics, not only because the wonderful combat system or the true survival horror experience on higher difficulty (i mean, if you like the genre TLOU2 on survivor or grounded is AMAZING). But also because the most hated aspect: the plot. The story of this game is deep and complex, the characters are not “flat” and the game puts you in front of the reality of the non existence of “good” and “evil”, but only of action and consequences. A lot of people hate this game because you play Abby, but this is the best part of this game: you live two stories, you understand both reasons, you empatize with two opposite characters which are also e enemies. The whole point of the game is the relativity of things, a fact that is part of our world and even more of a post-apocaliptic world.
I mean, TLOU2 has its flaws, in both the world setting and plot, like barely every game, but the story of this game is very deep, profound and let you through an emotional amazing experience. With the amazing gameplay and post apocaliptic world exploration, that’s really barely everything you can ask from a game like this!!!
The hate for this game has showed, sadly, how immature the fanbase is: the fact that a complex story, with a gray reality in which there isn’t a clear “good” and a clear “evil”, has create a crisis in those who usually see the reality in black and white. Also, it’s a common part of human nature the fact that we feel being part of a “side” (“team Ellie” or “team Abby”), and trying to open your mind to the “other side” is difficult but it’s part of a person’s maturity. Having to deal with the need of open your mind to the other side, and empatize with a character that you hate for half of the game, is one of the best( if not THE best) aspect of TLOU2, and it should also be considered a pedagogic videogame experience from a psicological and moral point of view.
Maybe, many people still want to play a SuperMario game, with the hero saving the princess killing the incarnation of the evil.
If you don’t like the plot decision to kill Joel i totally understand it (rip Joel ♥️) but overcriticizing and hating this game simply because of this, without considering the whole story and game experience, it’s really a brainless fanbase type of behaviour.
It’s really not a good thing for the future of videogames industry, the fact the people hate this game because it’s a complex story with complex characters and a “two sides” plot.",0.6292986273765564

Jesus, you guys don’t do yourselves any favors by assuming the absolutely worst of anyone who dislikes the game.
I didn’t enjoy getting yanked away from Ellie to play as the antagonist for half the game, and forced to fight Ellie, a character I had no interesting in fighting. I didn’t enjoy the bad pacing either. I didn’t enjoy the whole “see, killing people is bad, we are a morally superior game developer because we’re showing it’s bad” messaging. We all know killing people is bad, I don’t need naughty dog preaching to me about it.
It had nothing to do with women characters (I loved playing as Ellie) or trans characters (really didn’t care one way or another by including Nev (?)). It was the mediocre, at best, storytelling and pacing that makes me dislike the game. Forcing me to play as the antagonist was just not a fun experience for me.",0.6159797310829163

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I hate to be the negative nancy in the comments, but I found Days Gone kinda bad.
The writting is awful compared to Last of Us. I guess it tries? But imo it misses the story/characters by a mile. I legit kinda hate Decan, the protagonist. Hes so negative, arrogant, and aggressive all the time. Ellie and Joel can be like that at times, but their quirks are soo much more fleshed out than Decan or anyone in Days Gone.
I hate comparing the two but Days Gone's font, aesthetics, and tone is very Last of Us-esq and personally I think thats the only reason it ever got green lit by Sony.
As far as gameplay goes, I could understand the appeal. You fight generic zombies or ""Freakers"" as they call them, but they do to put huge hordes on screen which is neat to see. But to see the really big cool hordes you have to play a substantial amount of a rather long game.
If Last of Us is your jam cause of story, Id avoid Days Gone.
If you really like action horror and horde slaughtering, Days gone might be for you.
Id rent it or try it on Playstation Now if you cant find it cheap.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Last weekend I finally understood the massive gap between seasoned gamers and the average casual player. And I mean, true casual.
I’ve always had strong opinions about modern gaming, like many Reddit users or overall people who hang out on platforms discussing about games. Many takes like “the AI is deaf and blind,” “games are too hand-holdy,” or “Ubisoft HUDs are vomit-inducing” are pretty common, even though they don’t reflect the market reality, those are the games that sell the most every year.
It’s fair to wonder why. Have players become less demanding? Is the AAA market ruled by cynical execs obsessed with numbers, and are the noble indies the only path to redemption (despite selling 5 to 10 times less than the biggest productions, even when critically acclaimed) ?
None of that. Compared to 15 or 20 years ago, gaming isn’t some nerdy niche anymore. Everyone plays. And when you’re making a game meant to sell enough to justify a $100 million + budget, you need to make sure it’s accessible for the largest pool of customers as possible. So, the truth is that a lot of people don’t realize how many things that seem trivial are actually the result of tens of thousands of hours of accumulated experience (sometimes since very early childhood) and it simply don’t apply to someone who buys one or two games a year since very recently. Elements of game design that feel completely intuitive to us aren’t intuitive for everyone.
Let's get back to my friend. She never had the chance to own a console or PC because her parents were insanely strict and old-fashioned, thinking games were a waste of time. She knows gaming culture, watches Let’s Plays on Youtube and Twitch streamers, but she’s only ever held a controller (or a keyboard) at some parties and gaming evenings at friends’ houses.
So when I invited her over to try out some games, she was super hyped. And… that’s when it hit me. A few examples that really stood out:
Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 — Noticing that something shiny wasn’t just decoration but actually an item to pick up. Since it’s done in a way that blends with the art direction, she completely missed so many of them, I had to point it out every time. In combat, parrying was just impossible for her as she hasn't the reflexes for it. I had to handle the mime in Lumière myself. The Evêque (the first boss) took her six tries on the lowest difficulty, when I beat him first try on the hardest.
Cyberpunk 2077 — Completing the full tutorial (the Militech shard) took her thirty minutes. Reading enemy patrols, figuring out how to sneak without being seen, taking down enemies from behind, using cameras to scout areas… too many systems to absorb at once. Fist fight tutorial, she couldn't at all parry so I did that part to complete the task. She died 2 times to rescue Sandra Dorsett. And we're still on the easiest difficulty.
Assassin’s Creed Shadows — every stealth section was PEAK gaming for her. Intense and thrilling, while the average Redditor complains it’s too easy because the guards are brain dead.
It Takes Two — Trivial platforming sections to me were a big challenge to her.
Sonic Generations — Simply unplayable, it was way too fast to follow.
And that’s not even mentioning things like getting lost in open worlds (thank for all those HUD markers), or how non-intuitive core design elements can be for her like spotting climbable areas, handling inventories, crafting weapons, skill trees, knowing what to pick… all of that.
But beyond the gameplay struggles, I was genuinely emotional seeing her light up like a kid discovering something new. A game where you can go anywhere, grab a car and explore, enter buildings freely, listen to random NPCs and their stories. Watching her play Black Ops 6, her first Call of Duty, having fun despite a 0.15 K/D, then getting matched with players at her level thanks to SBMM when the game understood it wasn't me behind the keyboard, and even finishing some games with a sightly positive ratio (if it was me playing in that lobby, I would've easily dropped a nuke without even trying). It reminded me of myself in 2005, loading up San Andreas into the PS2 for the first time, or discovering FPS with Halo 3 and Modern Warfare.
To conclude, gaming wasn’t better before. We’ve just become so experienced, so trained to spot every mechanic and subtlety, that some developed deep apathy and the few games that still manage to surprise them become “the best game ever made.” But for the average player, something like AC is mind-blowing, while the average forum user tear it apart at every mention. Hollow Knight ? Way too hard. Soulslikes? Forget it, beating the first enemy is unthinkable. But they don’t care. They’ll stick to their three AAA games a year based on how cool the trailer or the ad before the Youtube video was, enjoy them, stick with what they know, because changing habits means starting from zero and relearning everything, and that’s perfectly enough for them. That’s how “AAA slop” sells millions, while the indie darlings adored by forums and critics barely reach a third of those sales, even when they’re massive successes for their devs.
EDIT : think that in light of some of the comments, I need to clarify something.
I get the impression that the definition of “casual gamer” seems a little narrow for some people. Casual doesn't just mean someone who only plays chill games for half an hour a day. And hardcore gamer doesn't mean a sweat or a nolife. At least, not in my native language.
For me a casual gamer could very well be someone who only plays the usual trio of FIFA/COD/GTA, someone who like to play more broad stuff but only for an hour a week, someone who plays for an hour a month... in short, people for whom gaming isn't really their main activity and for whom changing games is a huge challenge because they don't necessarily want to learn everything all over again. Go work in a game store to see what you'll be spending your days selling. It was a student job I did a few years ago, and when you suggest another cool multiplayer shooter to the guy who comes in looking for Call of Duty but finds it's out of stock, he'll say, “Nah” and pre-order a copy to pick up as soon as it's back in stock.
My friend isn't a complete novice either, because that implies someone who knows absolutely nothing about gaming and is discovering the mechanics for the first time. She's someone who didn't have her own hardware, but who spends time watching streams and has still had some experience here and there. That's casual gaming.
It's not a single monolith. Yes, there are casual gamers who don't want to be pushed around. There are others who are keen to try something new, but the games they're looking for still need to be minimally playable. That's why there are easy modes. That's why there are accessibility options everywhere. There needs to be something for everyone, and that's a good thing.",0.6040427088737488

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Yeah, I really dont get the point of the post. If you pulled out a caveman from 20K BC and played him some of the worst music of our time, he'd probably enjoy the hell out of it, that doesn't mean everyone critiquing the music is wrong.
If someone without a kid loves your kids and thinks they're so cute and great, doesn't mean you need to take a step back and stop critiquing their actions, lol.
Our time is valuable and playing anything is a waste of time. We already know what we like and enjoy, so of course we'll deviate to something that fits our taste, or critique a game that we like but has executed certain aspects badly. We do this for everything in our lives. As we get more experienced in one thing, our standards increase.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Arcade games were the kings of ‘easy to learn, hard to master.’ Simple controls, a 2d perspective, but that simplistic gameplay increased in challenge fast. They had addictive gameplay loops that made you want to keep trying. 
What op’s post is about is design language, I think. Controllers now have like ten buttons and by and large games are 3d. Even if you’d never touched a game in your life, you can figure out the goal & gameplay in pac-man far more easily than, say, Cyberpunk. Moving in 3d space and having an intuition for how to use a camera, which items and parts of the environment are interactable, enemy ai, and so so many more things. Razbuten’s girlfriend reviews on youtube are a way more fascinating, in depth look at this imo. 
We are blessed today to live in a world with an absolutely plethora of games for everyone. Unfortunately, this is a rabbit’s paw situation where this makes many AAA games feel desperate to keep their large audience playing at all costs. If you have hundreds of games at your fingertips (on top of paid games having to compete with f2p) it’s less likely a player will stick with one that’s tough and confusing. You can switch back over to tik tok or whatever too. The attention market is CRAZY now in general. It’s not like when I was a kid and I had like three games total and got new ones rarely. If there’s too much friction, many people just get frustrated and quit. Those with a lack of game design language knowledge will quit even faster. When your title has a 200 million dollar budget, you can’t afford to have that. The games gotta go down smooth.
Luckily for us, we have the whole indie market and some AAA games too after Dark Souls came on the scene. ",0.6204847097396851

when we're watching(preferably on our big screen!), I rewind as much as needed, likewise if might have lost something, point some details I know/noticed out, we comment but without interrupting, we may discuss/monologue later, I help enjoying Soundtracks I can pick out, I want to laugh, I kinda want to be afraid, I want to cry, I want to sing/hum along, I want to cheer, {with the appropriate pieces}sometimes I want to feel horny, I want to appreciate new Art styles, I want to coo, I want to rizz myself, I want to enjoy myself, I want to feel!...(...because that means I'm still alive(and a man)) I also found getting the best graphics quality matters here!;
when I Game, I like to take as much time as I can, check out every mouse hole, option, interaction, try if I can find bugs, I switch all the sounds on especially while checking stuff out, and using for it my best headphones available - at the very least once - is an ultimate goal, I tend to pass on an easiest difficulty first, foremost, and maybe even only, in spite of being a completionist[and challenging myself at least on the constant basis], if it is not necessary to do otherwise, also, meanwhile I enjoy vast majority of Music, it's been my newer Love to simply take the Tracks in in awe/bouncing to Them/other way, so a menu may be my first ""hype stop"", I re-read and rewatch for understanding and really like it, and again, I want to feel, I want to live;
listening to Music, turning up volume(and -phones working well) makes a big difference, melodies are pretty much always good, in doubt push your headphones deeper, listen to more instrumentals, check out other languages, if you can, move to the rhythm, tap, stomp, sing along, just to feel alive!, I re-listen in different tempos and pitches and maybe even try out beautiful messes resulting from applying the most basic lyrics-muting feature with Songs I already liked, too.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I respect your opinion but how was that good writing? Abby has been slaughtering and torturing Scars, Lev's people for years. Why would she have a change of heart within 2 days?
Why did Owen have a change of mind. It's clear that the Scars vs WLF war has been wearing on his mind. That wasn't what they were about. They went from looking to save lives to killing in a faction war. Those are two different life paths. So clearly one isn't what they want.
Why would Lev have a change of heart in 2 days.
It was more Yara than anyone else. It's clear that Yara is the one person that Lev is going to be behind more than anyone else. When Yara tells Lev to cut Abby down she saw something in Abby. On the way to the Hospital you see Lev and Abby slowly starts to see Lev for more than a Scar. Abby see Lev is someone she can save a protect, which is what her life path is. You see her nightmare turn into a happy dream of her father when she save Yara with the medicine.
Weird example but if you left an abusive relationship and your ex was still abusing other people and you know this for a fact but suddenly they have a change of heart and are nice to you for 2 days would you forgive them and trust them and let them back into your life?
This is definitely a weird example because it's trying to force an example to make a point. The game definitely could have developed it more over more days but the game is already a long game, so things had to be condensed.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Hello everyone,
Thank you to everyone who joined us during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta weekends—your passion and feedback have been invaluable. With tens of thousands connecting on Discord to play together, over 600,000 hours streamed, and over 30 million hours watched, your enthusiasm and participation is what made it great!
Initial Learnings and In-Game Changes
As we approach the launch of Battlefield 6 on October 10, we’d like to take a moment to look back at the recent Open Beta to share our key learnings and in-game changes we’re making based on your feedback and in-game data.
Weapons
We’re making targeted adjustments to deliver a more consistent and rewarding gunplay experience. This includes a general pass on recoil and tap-fire characteristics across all weapons, further emphasizing their unique feel and improving range differentiation. We’ve also made changes to encourage more controlled tap-firing and burst-firing, rewarding precision and weapon mastery. Additionally, the M87A1 shotgun now requires more pellets to secure a kill. We are investigating the Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death experiences, and we will share an update if definitive changes are made in these areas.
Movement
Movement mechanics have been adjusted to create a more balanced and traditional Battlefield experience. Momentum, especially horizontal speed, carried from a slide into a jump has been reduced. There is now a greater penalty for consecutive jumps, which lowers jump height when jumps are spammed. Firing while jumping or sliding will result in increased inaccuracy. These changes are designed to make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights, and will contribute to a gameplay pace that rewards skillful movement without becoming too fast or unpredictable.
Parachute physics have also been re-tuned, with reduced initial acceleration when opening the parachute for more controlled aerial movement.
Maps
We observed some players finding a way to reach rooftops and venture out of bounds. This gameplay is not intended for these maps, and the upcoming ladder for the Assault class is also not designed to access these areas. We’re actively working on adjustments to prevent unintended access and ensure gameplay stays within the intended boundaries.
We also heard strong feedback from players excited by the larger-scale maps that Battlefield has to offer. While the Open Beta featured smaller, more fast-paced maps, larger-scale maps are already part of our launch package, delivering action-packed gameplay and memorable, unique moments for every player. As part of the upcoming Battlefield Labs testing, we’ll be testing two new multiplayer maps: one set in Mirak Valley, the other a remake of the fan-favorite from Battlefield 3, Operation Firestorm. These two maps include the full complement of vehicles, like Liberation Peak, along with a more vast combat space.
Modes
When it comes to Rush, the conversation we observed wasn’t just about player count, but also about how maps play, and the tactical experience they offer. Rush is a mode with deep roots, originally known as Gold Rush in Bad Company, where matches typically ranged from 12v12 to 16v16 players. Many of you remember this as the golden era of Rush, and it continues to inspire our approach today.
We’ve experimented with larger player counts over the years, such as 64- and even 128-player versions. While these matches created intense, fast-paced moments, they also led to issues: Overwhelming defenses, stalled frontlines, and too many games ending in the first sector. Rush is especially sensitive to higher player counts due to its tactical and strategic requirements; when a player tries to arm the M-COM while more than 20 opponents are defending, the intended gameplay becomes less tangible. Based on feedback throughout recent titles, we’re lowering the default player count for Rush to improve the flow of combat and restore the tactical, methodical experience that defines the mode.
For those who enjoy large-scale Rush, Portal will allow you to experiment with different player counts at launch.
In contrast, Breakthrough is designed to accommodate higher player counts of up to 64 players, and that’s where the mode really shines. Using win/loss data from the Open Beta, we’re continuing to make map-by-map balance adjustments towards our goal of 50/50 win ratio for both Attackers and Defenders.
The Approach to Player Counts
There was some confusion around the number of players in different games so we wanted to take a moment to clarify our current direction for how these get determined. Rather than locking maps and modes to a fixed player count, our philosophy is to adapt to best fit the intended experience. This may vary by map or evolve over time with player feedback.
For example, at launch, some Breakthrough layouts will support 48 players, while others will have 64. It’s the one of many factors we adjust to create the right balance and feel for each scenario. In Breakthrough higher player counts work well on open, dynamic maps, while smaller player-groups offer a more focused experience on denser maps. Portal gives players the flexibility to try different settings and find what works best for their group and playstyle.
Finding the right balance is an ongoing process as everyone gets familiar with map size, lanes, and combat spaces. For now, we’ve found that 8v8 provides a solid starting point for small-scale, fast-paced modes like Team Death Match, Squad Death Match, Domination, and KOTH.
Playlist Options
A limited variety of playlist options were created for the Open Beta to both showcase and test the flexibility of the matchmaking system. For more details on our playlist adjustments, see our post about Open Beta Week 2 Playlist Options. Playing with both Open and Closed Weapons will continue to be options in Battlefield 6 and we are looking for ways to keep them easily accessible.
We recognize that some players experienced difficulty finding games to complete the Challenge of capturing sectors in Breakthrough or Rush. It wasn’t ideal and we’re actively using your feedback and in-game data to review and improve the Matchmaking system, with the goal of providing a smoother experience in the future.
Reflecting on the Open Beta & Next Steps
With the insights gathered during the Open Beta play sessions, we will be introducing in-game adjustments in upcoming Battlefield Labs events. Stay tuned for progress updates and future opportunities to get involved.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Lots of great points. It’s good to see you are listening to the players. I’m hoping you look into suppresing snipers, glare and removing auto spotting(this one especially).",0.6053630709648132
comments discussing gameplay experience,"First of all I LOVED the beta. I’m so happy.
I do however have one request. Kinda niche but the players that want it will be extremely grateful.
Bring back the option for Bad Company style legacy Tank controls. I don’t know what the current legacy controls are but that aint it. The trigger throttle, offers greater “stop/go” control and makes it easier to do maneuvers like back around a narrow corner at high speed. I just can’t maneuver nearly as well with the joystick throttle.
Again, I know there’s probably not a TON of players these days that have ever even used those controls but for it greatly enhance the experience for us old school tankers.
Thank you for your attention on this matter.",0.6147171854972839
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Honestly given the overall design choices and how much it has changed from all the other completely fine BF games for the sake of fast and intense gameplay, imma pass.
I'm sure reddit will have more than enough reviews a few months into the life of the game and maybe I'll reconsider then",0.6109239459037781
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I like their comments on the rush player count. They’re sticking to their guns. They see a lower player count as better for the default mode, but are also opening up higher player rush mode options in portal mode. That sounds fair to me. Like they said, Rush was a great mode back in the Bad Company days. 16vs16 was fine then.",0.6058167219161987

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Amazing feedback to the feedback! Movement penalties/jump+slide spamming was a big item of mine (slide to cover and jump to evade/climb, not attack) So was weapon balance, range, and burst-fire. Additionally a concern with cap point placement within maps, which I think may be addressed by adjustments to Breakthrough map details. Love to see it.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I 100% agree with the rush comments. I really loved the smaller player pool, it actually made you have to work as a team to exploit holes in defenses and I noticed a lot more squad engagement too.
Movement was definitely a required change.
With the rooftop exploits, we all saw that coming but I'm sure people will still figure out how to do it with ladders.
A menu UI overhaul is needed. That was one of the worst UI's I've ever used in a game, even 2042's menu was easier to use and I hated that too. KEEP IT STUPID SIMPLE!",0.6519830822944641

comments discussing gameplay experience,"How can I leave feedback on the beta? One change I would love to see is the option to move the minimap on screen. Ultrawide support is great overall, but with a 32:9 monitor, the map is basically useless as it's at the very edge of the screen.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"The lack of factoring in performance issues, which seem to be pretty atrocious, into the review scores is kinda misleading. Reminds me a bit of Cyberpunk but maybe to a lesser extent. Reviewers praised the fuck out of that game and then the release was a complete shit show and it wasn't a good look for those reviews.
These reviewers are playing on essentially the best systems you can get and a lot of them are still saying that there's frequent performance issues and frame drops below 60fps. So for the majority of consumers who don't have as good PCs will probably get near unplayable experiences. Yet these reviews don't really give that impression.",0.6064764857292175

comments discussing gameplay experience,"One of his notable comments was at the enemy AI's cone of vision being very poor or words to that affect. Which is the case in normal difficulty, I agree. My first playthrough was normal difficulty as well, and while I adored much of the game, there were parts of the game like above that improved playing it on a harder level. With resources being scarce. You need to take your time, and plan out. Two pistol bullets and a smoke bomb as you pull the generator cord in the basement of the hotel in Pittsburgh for example, or similar when taking on the sniper, etc. Whereas in normal difficulty you can pretty much all enemies as you have several shivs or Molotov cocktails in your inventory.
Not all games are enhanced by playing on a tougher difficulty setting, but this is IMHO.",0.602130651473999

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Reminds me of IGN reviews where they mostly shit on a game then give it a 7.5 or an 8.
""Terrible gameplay, mediocre story, meh visuals, framerate drops, too many glitches. 8/10, it has a little something for everyone.""
If you presented some of these 10/10 reviews to me without a score, and asked me to guess what score they gave the game, I'd have to guess somewhere between 78-95, depending on the review. Still a good or great review, just not a top game (well 95 still would be) of all time, based on the review wording.
The unscored reviews also seem to have a more negative tone that the scored ones. Not that they're all extremely negative or anything, but Polygon's review, Kotaku's, Skill Up's, etc. are especially harsh on the story, though I find Polygon's review a bit tedious. Now I think I'll like the game more than SkillUp or these outlets, since I personally liked the combat more than they did.
I'm certain this is still a very good game though, and I can't put down any judgement until I play. But this definitely reminds of a handful of other games that explode to 93-96 review scores, where the reviews themselves seem to be less positive than their score would make you think. If you compare the 100 review scores for this game to some other games with 100 review scores, and used that as a baseline, I would never guess that some of these TLoU2 reviewers gave the game a perfect score.",0.6024645566940308
comments discussing gameplay experience,"All the positive reviews will be called paid shills who are pushing a woke agenda or some other shit, while the few negative-ish reviews will be hailed as the beacon of truth by these Gamerbros. Just check the comments on Skill Up's review.
And just to be clear, I have no problem with Skill Up's review or any of the other negative ones. My point is that Gamers will point to that one video and say ""SEE! I TOLD YOU IT WOULD BE TRASH!"" while ignoring the 50 other reviews that say it's a masterpiece.",0.6487777829170227

That being said, I'm going to go ahead and leave my comment up here, but mostly as a standalone comment, and not nececarrily as a direct response to you. Sorry for the confusion.
If you read the Polygon review, that isn't it at all. It is that literally the game itself is preaching to you that violence is bad, but then gives you no other tool but brutally sadistic violence to solve your characters problems. After only giving you that tool to solve your problem with, it then turns around and shames you for doing so and tries to make you feel bad about it.
The ""violence is bad"" message isn't coming form the reviewer, it is coming from the game.
At one point as talked about in the review, it forces you to kill a dog by bashing it's skull in with a pipe, on screen, and then goes into a flashback cutscene of you playing with that dog in order to make you feel bad about it. Like, what does that accomplish? What is that supposed to make me feel, and if it even does successfully make me feel it, did such brutal violence against a dog need to be shown in such graphic detail in order to accomplish it?

You're also totally right in saying that neither games had a very good plot.
The first game absolutely made up for it's Cliche plot line with it's incredible immersion in the world and characters, character development, backstories and arcs, atmosphere, emotion, empathy and so on.
The second game on the other hand shot that in the leg within the first hour or two and by the second half of the game destroyed all of it completely and replaced everything that made the first games story so great with a forgettable, dry, dull, husk... and her name is Abby.
If Abby wasn't so unlikeable, boring and had the personality akin to that of a dry paper bag it might have been a slight redemption for the game overall but she is so utterly unlikeable, irritating, boring and apathetic that Naughty Dog might as well have swapped her out for Ted Bundy and the game would feel near identicle, I couldn't care less how many dogs Abby pets or plays fetch with because she's so unappealing as a character I couldn't care less, and it's pretty clear I'm not the only one who feels this way given the state of how much backlash it's faced among players and critics alike.
If you're just playing for the gameplay, sure the game's pretty great and even better throughout Abbies portion of the game, but gameplay alone can't make up for how awful every other aspect of it was and that's why the second game ruined the franchise for me.",0.6120783686637878

We encourage you to continue providing feedback on Discord, Reddit, and Steam by engaging in discussions with fellow sleepers about the things you enjoy and sharing any pain points that affect your gameplay.
This is kind of concerning though, since we all know that people with big opinions are not always aligned with the silent majority. Can you guys maybe roll out some surveys so the quieter voices have a say in the future of the game?
To make those moves easier, we will also introduce what we internally call a Base Backup Tool. This new tool lets you store your entire base, along with nearly all its contents, as an item in your character’s inventory.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Exactly this. A lot of the criticism is valid, but I'm seeing no praise of where the game is great. They do also need to know what's good so they know what is best to keep. For example, we need to be shouting that the movement is fantastic. Otherwise the people who want COD movement will be the vocal minority, and the devs will potentially patch to cater what is asked for. Basically, you should be giving the pros and cons... Not just the cons.
While the bugs/glitches need to be ironed out, and the game needs bigger maps (which both are a given), I think for the most part we should let them cook. At the end of the day, everyone has different opinions. Where one thing is changed for the better for one person, the next person thinks it's changed for the worse. They've smashed it with each update and are delivering on what we asked for generally speaking with the game as a whole. Let's not slam the devs constantly as they are no doubt working tirelessly to give us the best game they can while under EAs corporate thumb. They've given us the best shooter we've had in years, and no doubt themselves want it to be improved over time. They should be praised for this.
In fairness though, I look at other outlets like Facebook, and the BF threads are generally positive about the game as a whole.

I kinda understand this because, even though I agree with most of the criticism (like 90%), the sheer number of posts and hyperbolic over the top bitching can get exhausting at times.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I would have to disagree on several parts. The story felt mediocre at best, and the only reason I bothered to continue playing it was for stupid dog tag challenges.
REDSEC feels like a carbon copy of warzone, with the rare random vehicle lying about. It doesn’t do anything better than warzone, and it doesn’t add anything really new to the formula or mix. F2P battle royale is a shareholder cop out and it really, really doesn’t belong in a battlefield game. Resources wasted on this could’ve and should’ve gone to the actual battlefield game. If they’re so desperate for a battle royale release it as a standalone title not intrinsically baked into the game, splitting player bases and development time.
Multiplayer is an entirely curated experience where there is practically no negative space on the maps, you are where the devs want you to be and nothing else, there is excessive map tailoring to force near-consistent engagement at all times. There are practically no flanking routes, no extra streets or alleyways that don’t directly lead to an objective or one of the main firing avenues of the maps. Empire state would benefit greatly if, for instance, the lower L portion of out of bounds area of the map were to be included so the overall layout would be * a square city block*, and not whatever the hell it is now.
I have some qualms with the progression system of the game - by opening up the classes, it has brought all weapons and most gadgets to be unlocked through player level progression, rather than primarily related to your actual class progression or through challenges (which have had problems being made by Ai).
It’s an annoying change and forces you to have to grind until, for instance, level 49 just to get a mortar for support instead of through leveling my class or doing challenges for unlocks. These things aren’t game breaking, but with matches being so forcibly “high-octane engagement”, it is difficult to be able to even sit for more than 3-4 games at a time.
Just because it’s labeled BATTLEFIELD and is better than 2042 doesn’t mean we should just nod and clap our hands. We as the consumers have to voice our opinions and the complaints we have, and we have to stop conflating critique w/ enjoyment.
I enjoy the game, but It is not the best battlefield by a wide margin. Are some mechanics impressive and an improvement on previous generations? Yes, but there are also many parts of the Battlefield experience that were either walked back on, lost to development hell or shareholder desires. This is Battlefield but designed around metrics of call of duty levels of player engagement.",0.6207849979400635

CRITICISM IS NOT COMPLAINING.
You need to get that out of your head. The people giving fair criticism will in the end make the game better for everyone, including you.
I dont know why men think that voicing a critical opinion means that person is weak/crying or whatever. Maybe too many of us have been brought up in the notion that voicing discomfort equals being weak/unmanly.

Some of the best battlefield maps in history have been closer quarter maps with areas focused on high action engagements. For example Operation Metro, easily one of the best BF maps, if not one of the best FPS maps, ever.

Yes, there are issues that need addressing. These include bugs, balance changes, improved community tools (i.e. servers and Portal changes), a handful of UI updates, and maps with additional freedom of playstyle. Not a small list, but...
This game is nowhere near as fucked as we were with 2042, which had an abundance of fundamental gameplay issues, along with bugs. While BF6 isn't free of bugs on its own, it's launch stability is still better than that of launch BF4, which - some - consider a crown jewel of the franchise.
People with issues should have no problems expressing their critiques, and those who are enjoying the game shouldn't be antagonistic towards said group. However, I do think there's a small contingent of those with complaints who hyperbolize for no reason other than to foment animosity for engagement sake. That's never productive.
BF6 has a much better base to work off of than prior title, or even BF4. It just needs work.",0.6075207591056824

Look man the game is great, but it could be better. Main people are happy about all the improvements over past titles. At the same time, there is a loud part of the community that wants to see the game go in a direction that honors past game designs and grows into something that would rival BF3 and BF4.
Vince's DICE has done a great job at recapturing the soul of the BF series, now it just needs some work and heavy hands to stay on track. The DEVs deserve praise for what they have done, but EA / DICE should hear from angry fans if things are not panning out in ways that fans wanted or hoped for. Companies will walk all over your hobbies for monetization, if people want to counter that by being kinda of insanely pissed off in forums and on social media. I say let'em. The game's consumer base is sick of the live service treatments of the past decade, and I'm sick of it too. If a community manager has to look at a shit ton of nonsense so issues are properly conveyed to the team, sure whatever, that's his job he's being paid to have thick skin. No one is asking you to interact with the crazies, no one is gonna stop the crazies, and I promise you they will not make a worse game.
All the critiques I've seen that would have made BF a worse game, come from outside the community to turn BF into something its not. People want a classic experience.

With that I think feedback is useful, and I think overall a lot of people are playing and enjoying the game, and the fact that people might say negative things on reddit doesn't really change the fact that I'm having fun playing the game. I think there are hit reg issues still (there's a lot of irrefutable evidence for this too), there are ttk vs ttd issues, issues getting hit after you've gone behind cover, the maps aren't big enough, and plenty of other valid concerns. I think we need to make these things known, and I think they need to echoed so DICE can tell what the severity of these issues is and can tell what is a priority to the community. I don't think negative feedback is killing the game or is going to negatively impact the player base. I think there is some annoying level of complaints, but also they are easy to avoid. I think my only concern is people complaining about things that are kind of conflicting, like people complained about 2042 maps being to vertical and too big, and now we have small dense maps. This one is contriversial, but people want a server browser, but you know what match making works a hell of a lot better now, like most of the time I can actually get into a game with a party, and persistent servers with a server browser doesn't really allow matchmaking, because you're just picking your server.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Love the communication between the community and company. Makes us feel rewarded and heard. Can't wait for this game, man, FINALLY.
One point of feedback that I found interesting in the feedback:
""Players that played both Open and Closed Weapons playlists ended up sticking with Open Weapons, making us believe that Open Weapons is the way to go for BF6.""
I disagree with this take, and for one simple reason: I was one of the players that sticked with Open Weapons, but it wasn't necessarily because of the Open Weapons experience. It was mostly because it was faster to find a match in Open Weapons matchmaking than Closed Weapons.
Now, this makes the discussion a little bit different, but in an important way. Open Weapons playlists were much easier to find than Closed Weapons, and they were considering the ""Standard"". For example, if the ""Conquest"" icon in the Main Menu in the Beta were Closed Weapons, and there was another icon for ""Open Weapons Conquest"", would this make Closed Weapons more popular? Would it make the Closed Weapons playlist more popular than the Open Weapons playlist?
Either way, at least we still have Closed Weapons playlist separately, and we have Server Browser. All things considered, feedback and communication were a huge W, and it's good to know you guys are already noticing requests like Naval Warfare and Little-Bird.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Nice review, it's nice to see that inclusivity mattered.
I would just like to remind you that there's no black and white as to why people dislike the game's story. There's a vocal minority of incels bashing the game for a handful of reasons, but there's plenty of people that have gripes with the story and their gripes are kinda believable and have nothing to do with LGBTQ representation.
I've always been middle ground, I think TLOU2 is a superb game that anybody needs to experience and I'm happy I played it, but it didn't resonate with me the way the first game did.
It might be because I'm a cishet white male, but I don't think so, I'm definitely not an incel. I've never been bothered by LGBTQ representation, the more the better. My main issue is that I didn't like Abby that much as a character. Not because ""she killed my beloved Joel!1!1!!"", not because she was a muscle woman, just because I didn't like her attitude, her way of dealing with problems. I did think that her side of the story went on for a little bit too long and deviated from what, for me, was the fulcrum of the story.
But TLOU2 is still a gripping, tight, wonderful game deserving of all the possible praise.
The thing is, people who didn't like the game and aren't sad homophobic incels are actually much more than you might think, and are open for dialogue and bashing them by grouping them together with a very loud minority isn't really fair and it generally leads to the usual back and forth
""I like the game, people who don't like it are homophobes""
""People who like the game are stupid leftists who don't think with their own head"".

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Talking about this game around the time it was released wasn't the most pleasant experience. It's hard enough discussing video games on the internet since a good chunk of people who frequent public forums behave like manchildren. It wasn't hard to differentiate who had legitimate gripes with the game, and who was just acting like a braindead reactionary.
I love TLOU2's Grounded difficulty, and shockingly, I have 154 hours clocked. My only issue with the story is its pacing. It's fine during Ellie's half. But then things sort of tank during Abby's story, when you're hit with dozens of flashbacks and slow walking cutscenes. NakeyJakey had a pretty solid review even though I disagree with some of his criticisms.
Still one of my favorite games, though. I'm not too keen on Naughty Dog remaking the first game, but I'm looking forward to TLOU2's Factions... whenever that gets released.",0.6305989623069763

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I'll respond to this post with a few points that might reasonably apply to others.
The word ""apologists"" is somewhat incendiary; I'll give you that. But in it's classical sense, an ""apology"" is just a defense, and it was in that context that I intended the title. This letter takes the form of an attack, and it warrants a defense from people on the other side of the issue. I'm definitely not the ""end-all-be-all of video games,"" but I've played a lot of video games, I know which gaming elements frustrate me, and I can articulate why.

I don't mind being called petty, but you get that you haven't actually offered any reasons for why my complaints don't matter, right? Does the entire weight of your argument rest on the backs of all the people who liked this game? Do raw numbers exclusively determine the value of a work of art? I think that's a dangerous position, and I would argue that there's merit in distinguishing between the quality of a piece of art and the popularity of a piece of art.
First question: did you play TLOU? If you did, did you expect anything different from TLOU2? Second question: did you really expect Doom or Wolfenstein from TLOU2?
I definitely played the first one. Still one of my favorite PS3 games. And I think I admitted that some of the issues in this game's level design might have just been artifacts that I was more willing to overlook in 2013. But I think it's somewhat disingenuous to call this game ground-breaking if it's essentially just repeating the same gameplay loops that we were all okay with in 2013. And I certainly didn't expect Doom or Wolfenstein. For reference, I was willing to play a ton of RE3, warts and all--and that game had a lot of warts.
I said this to my wife (she didn't care; she was only listening to be polite): I think TLOUP2 is kind of a victim of its predecessor's success. Days Gone already borrowed heavily from the original's ideas, repackaging all the crafting and stealth and zombies into an open-world package that felt like an open-world successor to the game I loved in 2013. Days Gone had a painfully straightforward story and some pretty terrible characters, but it made up for its deficiencies in player freedom and raw fun. To go back to something far more restrictive feels pretty regressive.",0.6008979082107544

We didn't want Joel to die, to play; let alone sympathize with Abby, and we didn't want Ellie to end up with PTSD that causes her to throw everything good in her life away, just to not actually get revenge.
I think what they could have done is actually side track the revenge at the rattlers and they have to team up to escape.

Naughtydog was clearly drawing parallels between Ellie and Abby showing that they both have reasons for what they’re doing even if they aren’t justifiable and that there aren’t really correct choices sometimes.
I come from a position where I never really played or saw the first game but the controversy made me check out the second all the while waiting for this awful twist where the story becomes horrible considering what I heard and that just never came to pass.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I've not played the game as I don't have a PS but watched both games through YouTube playthroughs and I actually think it gave me a unique perspective. I adored the story (I thought the gameplay looked fine but obviously can't judge as I didn't play it myself and some said it gets repetitive). But I understand the hate now. I think this is the most ambitious and divisive possible way to have made the sequel and I give props to Naughty Dog for that. However, others who actually had to play as Abby for half the game and didn't like her..... Jesus I feel sorry for them.
As a passive viewer, this was one of the greatest experiences I've ever got from gaming (like the first one was) but for all the fan boys who worshipped Joel for 7 years and dreamed of their sequel, I sincerely hope they all emotionally recover because this game will get a very different reception in 10 years without the hype and with both games being played back to back like you did. I'm not picking sides purely based on future predictions but I do think the game will have so much more appreciation in about 5 years minimum.
Regarding common complaints about the story, I think on paper as a script the story is undoubtedly amazing but the way it is presented and how the gamer interacts with it can completely go the other way. People say Joel's death was unrealistic but he did trust several people in the first game (everyone just talks about the one fake injury man) and also gave his name willingly multiple times. The idea he wouldn't have trusted Abby (short term) considering the situation of the horde and blizzard, is utterly ridiculous and a sign of people who just can't accept that Joel died. It's like my 4 year mourning period over (GAME OF THRONES SPOILER ALERT) Stannis when I just kept saying it was terrible writing. Then after watching it all again and ignoring the books, I thought the arc was incredible despite the pain the viewer experiences. People who just say Abby is a ""weak character"" with no basis are obviously biased because they just don't like her.
However, there are many real story and gameplay criticisms that are valid opinions and I can see scores for this ranging realistically from 5 to 10 out of 10. I would call this a 10 and my favourite example of true artistry and risk in gaming but some others will hate it and call it 5. That is life. I love watching the shit storm online. This is living in the times of the premieres of Beethoven's Grosse Fugue or Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. Not saying TLOU2 is a genius masterpiece and will be hailed by everyone in 10 years but it will keep growing in appreciation and people will always remember the controversy at release. Some people still hate those music pieces today and some will hate TLOU2 in 10 years.

In my defense, I chose the word vice because he quotes a line from Togashi Yoshihiro’s Yu Yu Hakusho right before that part, where he says the scene reminded him of the said line which roughly reads “the dirty pleasure derived from thinking of showing an uncensored pornography to a innocent girl.”",0.605442464351654
comments discussing gameplay experience,I agree with some parts. I think part of the trauma of this game is the gameplay of being forced to play as Abby. I had to stop playing the game and sold it because it was too much for me but I wonder how my experience would be if I were to watch the game like a film? I think I will get more out of the story that way.,0.618839681148529

comments discussing gameplay experience,"A lot of what I saw was people saying they changed the characters, as if, people don't change. Especially when they suffer massive emotional trauma. Like, not only is Ellie 4 years older but she was hurt by Joel and then killed infront of her, of course she isn't the same optimistic 14 year old.
And somehow people are unable to see Abby as anything but a ""despicable piece of shit"". Obviously she's far from perfect, but they completely disregard her efforts to be better.
And yes, I really enjoyed it. Probably my favorite gaming experience ever. I played a couple hours a night after my roommates went to bed, it was all I could think about all day.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Well, not gonna go back and forth with you, but my opinion is you're viewing the entire thing from the wrong perspective. There is no hero, everyone is in the wrong, they all make mistakes. Abby clearly learns killing isn't the answer. Ellie may kill a ton of people, but it took that experience to end that cycle. I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it, but I've never had a more enjoyable gaming experience.",0.6270480155944824
comments discussing gameplay experience,"i said i didnt want to get into arguments. people have been pretty nasty when talking about this game and i just wanted to have a discussion, not get cussed out online.
granted i played the game months after release, i didnt hear anything about bugs or UI problems. my playthrough was as technically sound as any game i've ever played. the UI/UX was everything i needed it to be while being minimal as possible. the presentation and transition from cut scenes to live gameplay was smooth and as seamless as i've seen since God of War.
Joel was overly cautious in part 1, but they were also being chased by a hoard of infected and if they didnt flee with abby to their cabin, they all would have died from the infected. also, people make mistakes, which i think is a major theme of the game overall. there's a also a difference between a grown man in the middle of the road claiming his car broke down (as a trap for an ambush in the first game) and seeing a teenage girl with an infected on top of her. was this the absolute strongest possible way to get abby to joel, maybe not, but is is far from game breaking.
joel did save abby, but in the eyes of a child who's father was murdered, i'm not sure that all is just immediately forgiven. abby was consumed by revenge, she spent 4 years training to be a killer and ruined relationships in favor of following leads and then traveled nearly 1000 miles in the winter to find joel. upon suddenly hearing his name and realizing who he was, i can only imagine all the years of pent up hate and anger came rushing forward and the idea he saved her was the last thing on her mind.
i think you're reading too much into the dog thing. ellie was fighting the WLF, who had dogs. abby was part of the WLF, who had dogs. it seemed far more like a new game play mechanic to add enemies who could track your movement than some ploy to make ellie less likable. with or without dogs, abby was justified in killing joel, from her perspective.
the them is revenge is bad, but forgiveness, salvation and redemption are also themes. i was especially relieved when ellie let abby go. the game had made its point, everything abby was close to died because of her actions. abby also lost a close friend in jesse and ultimately her girlfriend and family for continuing to go after abby. ellie was only ever able to see joel in her mind being killed and it wasnt until she let the cycle of violence go, that she was able to see joel happy and alive in her mind. after all the killing, all the PTSD, everything she realized it didnt get her anywhere. as abby was seconds from death, she didnt feel better. what better way to say ''revenge is bad'' than to show her only personal salvation coming by letting the revenge go?
i dont see killing a main character as a cheap plot device, i see it as emotional motivation to carry out a story about revenge. joel was a beloved character, but ultimately, a fairly boring one. his arc was the highlight of the first game, from cold ruthless killer to redeemed father figure. just as in game of thrones, killing a loved main character leaves far more interesting options than basing the game around him again. his absents creates a vacuum that is far more interesting to fill.
they did the build up in reverse through flashbacks and having played the first game, once you know abby is jerry's daughter there's plenty of build up knowing joel killed him. creating a tragic and shocking moment early in the game sets the stage for a raw, emotional journey and creates instant hate for abby. they wanted you hate abby intensely which leads into my next point:
hating abby as much as i did and then being made to play her i dont see as manipulation, i see it as understanding and empathizing. joel was the villain of abby's story and eventhough she savagely killed joel, you can't play as her for 10 hours and not at least understand where that came from. i went from hating her so much, and feeling motivated to kill anyone in ellie's way to get to her, to genuinely hoping she survived at the end. i see that as an emotional journey, rather than manipulation. people were free to continue to hate her, but at least the game gave you the information to decide for yourself. i do see an argument for giving the player a choice whether or not kill abby at the end. however, letting abby live wasn't about abby, it was about ellie. if ellie had killed abby, she'd be lost emotionally forever. by sparing abby, it spared ellie.
and i assume by breaking with previously established characters, you mean ellie not being a hardened killer in the first game. well, i'd imagine watching your father beaten to death with a golf club would change a person. abby didnt even see her father killed and it certainly changed her into a killer, blood thirst for revenge, at the cost of everyone around her. i also think ellie learning the truth about joel taking her out of the hospital changed her. she specifically told joel she didnt want her life to mean nothing and when she found out joel prevented her life from potentially saving humanity, that changed her too. even before joel's death, during the opening of the second game, you could already feel ellie's shift in personality. she's 4 years older, had been through hell and felt like she had little to live for/that her life's purpose was taken from her.",0.6368112564086914
comments discussing gameplay experience,"So, I'm really late to this thread, and I have my own opinions on this game (not all of them amazing). But I formed these opinions by playing each videogame, all the way through.

comments discussing gameplay experience,I support his review 100%.,0.602853000164032
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I'm glad that you liked the game, friend. I thoroughly disagree with you, but I respect (and even envy) your love for the game. What follows is my personal take, with no hate, but with the intention to explore and give a different perspective.
I think it's a good game overall, really polished. Great graphics, acting, sound. All good.
The gameplay evolved very little from the first game - as well as throughout the game itself. It's a long game; having such little variety was a real negative point, IMHO. Lack of enemy diversity was a bummer as well. Why not use more insane clickers? Maybe it's wishful thinking, but I think it would help a lot in the dynamics of the game.
The greatest sin regarding gameplay, however, is the dissonance between gameplay, story and themes. We see Ellie being emotionally destroyed by her experience during cutscenes, her pursuit for revenge - at the same time, we John Wick throughout the game, with no negative consequences gameplay-wise. Shit, it's fun as hell to brutally kill anything in the game. I think that the gameplay could have reflected better her struggle. Something like if you kill too many human enemies consecutively, Ellie's aim would get less reliable, her breathing would get louder, making it difficult to stealth, etc.
Regarding story, I think that Joel's death is the least of the problems. In fact, I don't consider it a problem at all - it was totally expected to happen. A Ned Stark level of shock would be to kill Ellie and have Joel go on a revange quest - which would not necessarily be good, but would be more shocking than Joel dying.
The storytelling is the biggest problem, IMO. I think it would be awesome, for example, to start playing as Abby, get to know her, get to love her (she's is a great character in the game!) and slowly discover that the person who killed her father was Joel. She kills Joel and the rest of the game we have this lingering dread: two characters that we love having to confront each other. Or even make Part II only about Abby, then a Part III about the clash between her and Ellie. I don't know, I'll not pretend that I have a better solution; I get that the game as is wants to convey a similar message. But I do believe that the writing team is not as good as they think they are.
The end is just sad, and I feel it is just for the sake of being sad, you know? Leaving Ellie in her worst nightmare (alone, all by herself) is, indeed, a bold decision. But I feel that, in contrast with the first game's message, it has little nuance, little payoff for a 25+ hour game, little to no catharsis.
All in all, I don't regret playing the game, nor think is a pile of flaming trash as some haters suggest. Likewise, I don't think it's a masterpiece, not by a long shot. I think it's a great case for not making sequels when not absolutely needed.
Again, no hate. I envy you for liking the game; I wish I was the same. As it is, I think it's a good game - and that's fine. Cheers! :)",0.6213559508323669
comments discussing gameplay experience,"wonderful response. i loved your ideas about killing too many humans having game play effects on ellie, thats brilliant!
i thought about the playing as abby first part, but i think its much tougher to get players to like or accept a character they hate, than it is to get them to forgive someone they already like. and by the end, i found abby very likable and didnt want her to die, and to me that's a much greater achievement than just forgiving her, i came full circle from hating her and looking forward to killing her to liking her and wanting her to live, that to me was super impressive.
i actually liked that the gameplay wasnt much different. i just thought it was soooo much more refined and satisfying than the first game. i didnt need a ton of new mechanics and more controls and all these new systems. the weapons and upgrades were deeper and better and the combat more brutal, intense and engaging. i really just wanted more of The Last Of Us, not a jump from GTA4 to GTA5.
its not a feel good game, it dont think a happy ending makes sense. i was excited for ellie to get back to dina but when she got back to the empty house it felt like the right ending.
while the game didnt ""need"" a sequel, i certainly wanted one and didnt think it was a stretch to have one. Joel did some fucked up shit and there were bound to be consequences.
im sorry you didnt enjoy it more, to me, it was the best gaming experience i think i've ever had, barely above God Of War and Red Dead 2",0.6290051937103271

comments discussing gameplay experience,"OP, I just finished the game and found this post hoping for dear God that there were some other people out there mature enough to appreciate how incredible that story was. I also 100% agree with the points you laid out in the post. This was the greatest story I've seen in a video game. Incredibly compelling, complex, emotional. It's a God damn shame that people aren't able to grasp that the entire point of the story is to feel the exact emotions people are getting mad about. You're supposed to hate Abby at first! You're supposed to hate hunting Ellie when you play as Abby! Etc etc - the game forces people to do these uncomfortable things because it further reinforces conflicting emotions and that feeling of discomfort is a beautiful thing.
It honestly makes me so sad that apparently the average gamer cannot appreciate the nuance of this incredibly well done story. Glad to see some other sane people out there.",0.605179488658905
comments discussing gameplay experience,"So glad to hear it!! I do understand it's difficult to play through something that's feels wrong, the hunting Ellie with someone you hate. Like I get it. And not that I would have quit, but feeling soo compelled to find out what happens.
I think people like scary and tense but struggle with uncomfortable. And this game is fucking uncomfortable. It's not a happy ending, it's not all wrapped up with a bow, it's doesn't leave you feeling good. But holy fuck is it an experience you just cannot miss. I've never been so immersed in any game before, RDR2 is close, but this story is just so, I don't even know, intense I guess is the word. Like I legit cried at the end of RDR2, but at the end of this, I felt like I needed to take a week off work and lay in bed and only watch comedies. And that probably sounds depressing lol, and like why would anyone want to play a game that makes them feel like that, but TLOU2 was easily, hands down, the greatest gaming experience I've ever had.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I liked this game about as much as the first one (very good, but not amazing). I cried a number of times and liked the direction they decided to go. I have a lot of complaints though. A few are story related and a few are gameplay related:
When you switch to Abby there's a few things that don't make sense to me gameplay wise. For example, why does this trained warrior not have basic skills in her perk tree? Why can't she get her hands on a knife so she doesn't have to make shivs? I'm pretty sure the WLF has access to knives. Honestly I think most of my complaints are around things of this nature.
The factions felt kind of empty. Like they didn't have a lot of motivating ideology or these things were sort of danced around to keep the appeal of the game as broad as possible.
I was disappointed that there was only one quasi-open world section. This part of the game felt like the biggest departure from the original and was honestly the most exciting from a gameplay/level design perspective imo.
It kind of felt like it ended more than once and I don't think they shot they went out on was the best choice. The scene immediately before where you finally get to see Ellie and Joel's conversation the night of the party should have been the end imo. The bit of Ellie back in the present putting the guitar back down and walking off that happens after takes away from the emotional impact imo.",0.6072602868080139

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I remember it being kind of development hell. They made this cool conceptual work and pushed it as real gameplay to get investors. The art director was the one to shape it into an actual game. These reviews are pretty much what i expected. I'm sure there's a good game there for some, but majority of people will be turned off by some rough gameplay or weird decisions. I bet older gamers used to seeing Daikatana ads will like this game more than someone who has only seen game previews online",0.6037024259567261
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Reviews are all over the place, but if there is one thing certain, it's on Game Pass which means I'm not outright paying for it, I'll just play it and decide for myself. It looks goofy enough to give it a playthrough.",0.6526930928230286
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I could see game pass really working in this games favor. Mixed reviews like this can stop someone from buying, but not trying. There is interesting stuff here and maybe enough to give the a chance to redeem itself with user scores.",0.6604622006416321
comments discussing gameplay experience,Skillup was definitely right that there is a spread of review scores.,0.6140684485435486
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Their reviews directly contradict each other at times. SkillUp says the dialogue sucks and the plot is super predictable, ACG says the twists are good and he liked the characters and even liked the sex upgrade machine. SkillUp says the combat is uneven, brought down by too many bullet sponge enemies but held up by visceral melee combat. ACG literally says the melee combat lacks impact but then praises the enemy variety. SkillUp praises the performance and says he didn’t have stutters, ACG says the game is hard to run and experienced stuttering.
I could go on. Guess I’ll just have to play it myself and go in with an open mind, good thing it’s on game pass.",0.6347333192825317
comments discussing gameplay experience,I mean reviews are subjective. Makes sense that different people would have different opinions on a very polarizing game.,0.6624836325645447
comments discussing gameplay experience,"he literally spends the whole video length complaining about every single detail
He ... doesn't? He praises aspects of the game more often than he criticises them, and maybe the stuff he's complaining about didn't affect his experience much. (It certainly sounds like it'd affect me a hell of a lot more tho, I've grown to really hate abysmal dialog and fetch quests).",0.6419571042060852
comments discussing gameplay experience,People just act and comment based on what they believe is true rather than reality. I see this all the time now and especially in Reddit comments,0.6237760186195374
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I dont get this sentiment. Their own website breaks down what the numbers roughly mean
8 - Great
These games leave us with something outstanding to remember them by, usually novel gameplay ideas for single-player or multiplayer, clever characters and writing, noteworthy graphics and sound, or some combination thereof. If we have major complaints, there are more than enough excellent qualities to cancel them out.
Examples include:
The Outer Worlds
The Division 2
Kingdom Hearts 3
GreedFall
Sounds about right to me.
EDIT: People, I dont care if you agree with the listed games or not. Contact IGN, they're the ones who wrote the reviews, not me.",0.6186330914497375

comments discussing gameplay experience,Yeah there’s def not a clear consensus. Seems like a good game to try for yourself on gamepass.,0.620331346988678
comments discussing gameplay experience,"From looking at multiple reviews in full the general consensus seems to be all over the place, but every single review, even the most negative one (SkillUp's video from what I've watched) say that they did enjoy the game all the way through. Good enough to give it a shot on GamePass for me after I'm done with Retrurnal and Persona 5 Royal",0.6098403334617615
comments discussing gameplay experience,"As a reviewer myself, I'm honestly surprised to see all the more positive reviews. The game reminded me of Duke Nukem Forever, a jumbled mess of semi finished ideas lacking focus and a single cohesive thread.
Also its hilarious seeing all the images of the big mommy robots that appear for like two seconds, unlike the rapey weapons upgrade machine which pops up every two minutes.",0.608944833278656
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Reviews appear a little disappointing, especially given the hype that’s been several years in the making. Looks like a perfect game to try on Game Pass really.",0.6106375455856323
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Honestly the massive range of reviews for this is just making me more curious. Good it's on GP so I can try it out and only waste my time if it's shite.
This feels like a game that will have many 2 hour long 'underrated gem' video essays in a few years time from the people that found things to love in it.",0.6056970953941345
comments discussing gameplay experience,"About 5 hours in so far. The reviews/comments about the writing and dialogue being terrible are well overstated, its in-line with other macho fps games, Wolfenstein especially.
If anything it seems like it was written in one language and doesn't translate to English's 100% and losses the humour of it like with the sex crazy upgrade machine. But its no where near enough of a thing to complain much about.
For gameplay it doesn't explain much or incentivise you to use your elemental powers much if at all and if you miss the splash screen when you first unlock them then you'd forget them altogether. No enemies or puzzles really need them to used for so far.
There's a bunch of other things of that nature that are also not explained much and feels like it lacks that kind of polish of unlocking weapons/powers dopamine do much better.
The voice acting I would say is awkward to bad and I wish there was a Russian V.O. option. VO is only as good as its directed and it feels very awkward listening to all these American voices in place of Russian/slavics about Soviet Russia, saying ""com RAIDS"" in place of comrades (lol wtf) and I would've been more comfortable with an English cast like so many movies and tv series do with stories of that area.
The story is a bit over the place and its hard to be invested because of the voices, I had this same problem with Horizon: Zero dawn. People thousands of years in the future in tribes with broken teethers to the old times that can somehow speak perfect English like they're theatre kids doing a play. Major disconnect.
Graphically its stunning at times and others generic but never bad. A problem I had with the Gamepass version on my tv was Vsync was un-selectable. Found a steam discussion saying to enable frame generation (even if you dont have a 40xx series Nvidia card) > restart the game > then you'll be able to turn Vsync on.
All in all its good game so far for a first time effort and a bit of ambitiousness it feels inline with its comrades especially like the Wolfenstein series.",0.6024724841117859
comments discussing gameplay experience,reviews be all over the place. very thankful for steam's refund policy - gonna give this the ol' 2-hour-try and see how it goes,0.6337547302246094
comments discussing gameplay experience,"In my personal opinion, I feel like a lot of reviews that bring up the gameplay experience in a negative light (i.e. sluggish, bullet sponge enemies, etc.) are expecting the game to be a run-and-gun experience like COD.
Technical issues aside, it really lends itself to being a more slow paced action-RPG.",0.6776993274688721
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Game is dogshit.
5/10 might go 6/10 if patched aggressively.
okay then",0.6155094504356384
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I’m yet to see many people really shit on the gameplay so I guess that’s good.
I’ve seen some clips of unfortunately cringe dialogue but what I don’t understand is how a game like Atomic Heart can be plagued with lazy, quippy writing and that dominates a large part of the discussion but when a game like Hi-Fi Rush he equally bad writing it’s a non-issue lol",0.6482081413269043
comments discussing gameplay experience,"What I get from all of these reviews is that the game is fun but other factors bring down the score. Writing, bugs, annoying protagonist, and awkward platforming seem to be the main culprits. Sometimes all I want to know is the damn game fun yes or no?
Honestly the annoying protagonist thing is probably just woke BS. They probably modeled him after an 80's action hero not a rocket scientist. In todays world an aggressive white male is automatically everything wrong with society.
I will have to see for myself since even game reviews have their own agenda.",0.6023232936859131
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Remember, reviews are only good to gauge performance, and from the sound of it this game is pretty well optimized on PC. The rest is subjective. Never take anyone’s opinion as fact.
Reviewers are just people too, often they know about as much about narrative as you or I, so whether something works or doesn’t work is purely subjective.",0.6378241181373596
comments discussing gameplay experience,"I definitely disagree about the over hype bit. For one of course they are going to hype their game. It doesn’t look like they lied or mislead the consumer in any way what’s so ever.
The reviews are more about how the game is inconsistent and rough around the edges but the world building is cool.",0.6115581393241882
comments discussing gameplay experience,"As far as I am aware, different people write the reviews and could give different scores, so I don't really see any major issues.",0.6059677600860596
comments discussing gameplay experience,"reviews say to me, either play it on gamepass or wait for discount. I'm pleasantly surprised because the first few times I saw this game, I flat up thought it was a tech demo of vaporware and was never going to come out. Hopefully it does well enough they can take what they learned from this and put out a better game next time.",0.6080470681190491

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I really liked it, gorgeous graphics, great animations. Some things do fall by the wayside but overall they really tried to punch above their weight and you can see this the effort in it.
The script I mean sure it’s not the best but I’ve seen worst come out of Hollywood.
I saw a review comment “its Bioshock with no taste” and I have to firmly disagree, to me it’s an acquired taste that may not please the masses.
Good effort overall better than other FPS that has come out over the past 3 years that’s for sure so a breath of fresh air.",0.6048784852027893

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I think alot of the comments may feel that way. But your comments are also feelings very defensive. It reads as though you're not willing to try and understand the perspective of your girlfriend.
The original commenter looked at it beautifully. That you're doing one thing and your girlfriend may be looking at it in a completely different way. And what that means, if though this is important to you and your intentions were one thing, she still has her perspective and feelings about it. It just doesn't seem as though you're willing to hold these moments that she's experiencing her feelings with it.
Doing so doesn't mean that you think you're wrong or that you need to stop. But she has her feelings for it and if she's willing to hear and hold your feelings, and listen to understand, and you can work with her on helping her feelings and understanding it, then maybe it doesn't have to be a point of conflict.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"because if ellie killed Abby before realizing her lesson it would make more narrative sense and be more interesting for Ellie’s development. Do you think the rumbling should have stopped earlier?
Your whole attitude about this is incredibly irritating. You’re in other comments claiming people missed the point of the show despite being incorrect about key information. You came here for a one way conversation, not a discussion, which is unfortunate as your theory is interesting and solid, but the fact you’re being a complete narc about it makes me not want to engage.
On that of that, you’re making definitive claims about things that are NOT definitive, or are open to interpretation. Neither Eren or Ellie are motivated by a “sole” factor. You are also arguing people in the comments have “fallen for the cycle of violence” again, while ignoring what perpetuated Eren and Ellie’s violence.
The world would be better off with their death - that’s true. But would you roll over and die? Would anybody? That’s what instigates them into action. By just blaming the cycle of violence, you’re essentially saying these characters should just get over it - the Zeke philosophy. Which as we’ve seen, only leads to more resentment and blind rage from characters like Eren and Ellie. The cycle of violence. To minimize any of that, is to write off the actual conflict of these stories - the human heart in conflict with itself. Dual motivations. Directly opposing motivations from the exact same character.
C’mon man.",0.6054808497428894

comments discussing gameplay experience,"It's a game that took a very creative and bold approach to its story but it felt more like it was in love with sniffing its own fart than anything else really. It's like - I can see, understand and somewhat appreciate what they tried to do, it's just one of those ideas that is much better on paper or as a case study than an actual story one reads / plays. It also featured elements that felt really ham-fisted and bloated the narrative too much which made it lose focus. It was an emotional roller-coaster but mostly because it put your emotions on rails. It didn't feel like you actually went through it, it was more like you watched it play out. I had no connection to anything happening.
The gameplay was pretty good though and there was a lot of attention to detail that showed high production value. But in the end... it's just a on the rails revenge story where I think something much deeper and more profound could've been instead with all the same basic story beats still intact. The way it actually was... it felt like forced melodrama and I still feel like people who thought this was some storytelling masterpiece have never read a novel more challenging / complex than Hunger Games or some other YA novel that was trendy.",0.6134037971496582

But that's where it stops for me. Once the story beats are all known, the game really starts to show that it's pretty...well, average is harsh, it's above that, but I just never found it doing anything that seemed particularly revolutionary. You go into an area, kill everyone there, and move on to the next one, until you hit a big set piece, then repeat.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"This is probably the most constructive and accurate feedback posted about the event yet. It's clear a lot of people making criticisms don't actually follow the lore and as a result often claim certain things that just flat out aren't true.
I agree with a lot of what you're saying here, particularly about the rookie and VN format. It really feels like the rookie was their attempt at getting non-lore fans to feel excited and connected to the story as it progressed but it really fails to do so in my experience. People who aren't interested in the lore aren't going to suddenly care if they get to make the occasional quip and people who ARE interested in the lore don't really care about a self-insert and just want to experience the characters and world.
The Marvel inspirations are VERY obvious with how the characters are handled as well. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it leaves some interactions feeling very cookie-cutter and cheesy at times (particularly with Olaf). The actual encounters with Viego feel very ham-fisted as well, every location feels more or less the same: Meet new sentinel, fight mist wraiths, encounter the fetter, Viego shows up, throws a Ruined champ at the group, leaves with fetter.
The lack of a central narrative team handling the event is also very evident. It feels like every team working on this had their own vision for the plot and didn't really communicate with the rest of the teams on a more cohesive plan.",0.6167958974838257

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I would like to preface this by saying that I am really in awe of your effort to describe your points of which you brought forth a remarkable amount! Around 7k words, around 39k characters! Took me a while to read. Then again, I'm almost never on reddit, so idk if it's a common thing to write large paragraphs of text here when discussing stuff.
You seem to be knowledgeable in literature, its study, its tropes & very much attentive to details which I find very commendable (especially for a league player /sarcasm).
So I read your whole essay & all your arguments & points of criticism became very apparent to me almost immediately.
However I was left with that weird feeling of ""Well, somehow, I just don't care, I just like the story & the event (even though I admit the VN format is rather crusty, but at least better than in spirit blossom)"". My willing suspension of disbelief was not shattered, which is also the reason why after reading all of that I will probably still enjoy the event. (The only point that really hit a nerve was ""Why is Gwen alive, but not the other objects?"" but my gf suggested ""Maybe cuz she was made by Isolde herself"" & I was satisfied :P)
Now I am really curious why that is & what might be your opinion on that.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I hope you understand my meaning. I don't say spiderman looks bad, I am just saying, it's 7~8/10 game, which is fine, even great, but it's not a game that deserve that much hype.
This might be a simple phrasing issue but one should be careful about making such absolute statements when dealing entirely with their own opinion. I mean, it may only look like a 7~8/10 game to you personally but that means nothing to anyone else. As such, saying that the game that ""deserves"" that much hype makes it sound like you are not just saying that the game is not as good as some make it out to be but also that your opinion is somehow more important than that of others.
It is kinda like when someone says something is ""overrated"". If you have hung around this subreddit enough, you have probably heard more than a few people say that such and such popular game is ""overrated"" but all they are really saying with such a statement is that those who did really like said game don't like it as much as they think they do. That their opinion must somehow be poorly thought out.
You list some games that you think are ""perfect"" and that is great. Heck, I love some of those games myself but everyone is going to have a different list and for different reasons. No one person's list is more correct than another because opinions are not meant to account for everyone, just the person who holds said opinion.
This is where I actually value (at least some) professional game reviews (and not the stuff you find from gaming youtube pundits and the like). In some of the better game journalism outfits, there is a certain expectation to take a step back from one's own opinions and look at a game from a wider angle. To understand that sometimes a game is pretty good and that some will value it and some won't.
Look, there was a time when I overestimated the value of my opinions in a pretty big way. I remember lecturing people for listening to pop acts like The Backstreet Boys or similar. I would go on and on about how they should listen to ""real"" music and that there is no good reason for modern pop acts to be popular. After a time, I found that it is not nearly as simple. It may baffle me that someone would want to go see a Miley Cyrus concert but those that enthusiastically do so are justified in their decision simply because they enjoy it. It is not my place to judge their taste and nor it is my place to judge the pop star for being a good pop star.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"If you spend enough time on this subreddit, or in any space where fantasy is often discussed, you will almost inevitably run into the magic system discourse. Someone yelling that ""Hard/Soft magic systems are bad!""
Let's be up front, the main response from folks is just to go ""then don't read hard/soft magic systems, there's plenty of hard/soft systems out there for you!"" Sometimes followed by ""how exactly do you define the hard/soft magic systems?""
Here in r/Fantasy, and in my own experience, criticism of Hard Magic Systems are more common. (And I'm a hard magic system author, so it's just territory I know better.)
I do think it's useful to take these criticisms more seriously than many commenters in these conversations. By and large, I sort the criticisms of hard magic into four separate categories, and I think it's useful to take a look at them, because they offer useful conclusions about the whole conversation. (Any soft magic folks who have noticed similar trends in criticism going the other way, I'd genuinely love to hear about them in the comments.)
The overwhelming majority of these complaints are just prescriptive aesthetic preferences, interesting only in what they say about the speaker- and I'm seldom too interested in biographical or psychological analyses of random strangers on the internet these days. On the flip side, nor am I particularly bothered by their aesthetic preferences- they're often quite articulate, thoughtful, and passionate about it. As long as they're not being jerks, I'm more than happy to listen to their opinions. Often, they come in seeking a sense of wonder, a very laudable goal. But it remains prescriptive aesthetics, in the end, and that's just not very generizable. Even those craving wonder sometimes forget how diverse inspirations for wonder can be- as someone who went to school for geology, I have regularly had my mind blown by boring-seeming rocks by the side of the road, for reasons that would take a long while to explain to folks with healthier interests than rocks. Hard magic systems can absolutely inspire wonder for many folks. Like most aesthetic prescriptivism, it is not entirely unfair to judge it as ""I like things this way, so that should be the standard."" (Again, that 100% applies just as hard to ""magic systems need to be harder"" folks, because they're absolutely out there too, if not quite as present in r/Fantasy. Don't pretend us hard magic folks are morally pure here.)
(There is a complex, thoughtful conversation to be had about the messy dividing line between base aesthetic prescriptivism and more substantive critical judgements- there's clearly such a thing as good prose or plotting, for instance, that passes at least a bit beyond aesthetics into some sort of principles of communications. Likewise, there is colossal room for the entire field of literary criticism that passes beyond personal preference. I know I'm supposed to dislike critics as an author, but I have quite a bit of respect for their craft. That's a whole different essay, though.)
The second common criticism comes from a place of desperate elitism- these I find even less interesting. These are far less often thoughtful or articulate than the first sort, and usually come from dudes who are way too into Blood Meridian, who just want someone to look down on to make themselves feel better. (Blood Meridian is a great book, just don't make it your personality, folks.) I don't find much value in examining this one further.
The final two categories of hard magic criticism are much more interesting to me.
The third one is a genuinely cutting critique, one that I've seen from folks ranging from randos on the internet to China Mieville himself, a perception of magic systems as being part of a Wiki/Wookiepedia approach to writing, canon, and nerddom, a compulsive need to taxonomize every last piece of fiction, to the exclusion of reflection and critical interpretation. (The critique often, including in Mieville's case, extends to a lot more than just magic systems.) I do think that there's some truth to that critique, those of us on the hard magic system end of things often get caught of in an endless cycle of worldbuilding, a relentless encyclopedic project of defining every aspect of a fictional world. There are, I think, valid defenses for this one- most notably the fact that encyclopedias and the sorting of knowledge is very much a good thing overall, please donate to Wikipedia if you can folks- but that doesn't detract from the importance of this vein of criticism. Encyclopedias may be a good thing, but that doesn't mean art should be encyclopedic. Ambiguity, uncertainty, and unexplored parts of the map are incredibly important for imagination and the fantasy genre.
I do my best to avoid this specific pitfall in my own writing using a variety of strategies- making sure that any worldbuilding I do opens up further questions, making sure that characters don't fully understand the magic systems, leaving plenty of ambiguity about whether the worldbuilding I offer is even totally correct, etc- but it remains a pitfall that I'm afraid of falling into with my own writing. It's a good critique of hard magic systems and their associated worldbuilding styles that, while certainly not fatal, deserves consideration and caution.
The final category of criticism, the one I find most interesting, is when the critic of hard magic systems comes with a claim for magic's purpose, a normative claim about what magic is for. I've seen, for instance, folks claim that magic should exist to care- that is, to be differentiated from physics by possessing intention. I've seen folks claim that magic should exist to deny rigid systems, or to commune with the mystical, or to just be strange and hard to comprehend. Some are vague, some are really cool, but they're all antithetical to the Hard Magic System Project (TM) in some way.
Here's the thing, though- those reasons, and others I've seen, well.. don't always work super well with each other. This isn't a disqualifier- I think those individual reasons often have great value- but they point to a fundamental truth about the purpose of magic systems to authors. Namely, well...
They're just tools.
You can use them for whatever purpose you want, in the end. In fact, I'd go so far as to say the purpose itself is the important part, whether you have a hard or soft magic system.
For myself, as a reader and writer, I'm most interested in using fantasy as a mirror or lens to consider our own world with. I like modeling magic as technology in order to investigate whether harmful social structures around our own technology were really inevitable in ""the name of progress"", or whether there were other paths we could have taken. (Go, Luddites! Woo!) I wrote an elemental magic system as a reflection on taxonomies, on their utility, and the dangers of reifying them. Other authors have their own purposes for their own magic- and, often, those purposes are obscure even to themselves, until well into the writing process. (Trust me, I speak from experience, there.)
Tolkien's purpose with his own magic- very much a soft magic system- revolved heavily around oaths, craft, and the outward expression of one's inner being. Le Guin's purposes in Earthsea- which, uh, may have had a hard magic system- revolved around questions of power and its limits, around Daoist ideas, around the arrogance of youth and more. Sanderson, who is absolutely a hard magic system author, seems obsessed with similar concerns about technology as me, around questions of magic as art and art as magic, and let's be real, with moving in cool ways through physical space. (I'm open to being disagreed with on any of these authors, I don't have any insight into their purposes than any other reader.)
(I highly encourage y'all to try this exercise of guessing at authorial purposes for magic systems with, say... N.K. Jemisin's genius Broken Earth trilogy. And whether it's a hard or soft magic system, for that matter- though considering how many rocks are involved in the magic system, I think the soft magic advocates are going to have a tough time. Insert rimshot sound here.)
And, in turn, readers all have their own motives for reading magic systems, which they use to unpack what the author has done, creating a complex interplay of interpretation and meaning. When I read a magic system through the ""development and social costs of technology lens"" that was written with much more personal, psychological inspirations and motives from the author, it often results in interpretations neither of us could have expected. This isn't unique to magic systems, it's a process that all worldbuilding (hell, all fiction writing) engages in, but we are talking about magic systems- and I do think it's a little easier to isolate the magic system conversation, most of the time.
One of the most common purposes for designing hard magic systems, for instance- one which plays a bit of a role in my own writing- is that of creating a sort of Agatha Christie-esque plot with it, a mystery play in which the readers are given the rules, then have to figure out how the characters will use the rules to solve their problems. (And, on the reader side, folks love theorycrafting magic systems, it's fun!) It's no grand, philosophical literary purpose, but it's still a damn good purpose, if you ask me. Fun and enjoyment are worthy.
I'm not particularly interested in trying to strictly bound what does or does not make a good topic of exploration for a magic system here, whether hard or soft. I don't think it's possible to set such a standard, given the base fact that different folks will find different value in the art they consume. For instance, do I get anything out of the theatrical performances of professional wrestling? Not at all. But I clearly and entirely recognize the fact that a damn lot of folks do, and I genuinely strive not to be one of those folks who tries to reconcile that disconnect by dismissing other folks as lesser for liking the ""wrong"" art. I'll leave speculation about their motives to others.
(HOT TAKE ALERT: Fantasy readers should try and read books with magic systems other than they prefer sometimes, they can both be excellent, and reading wider varieties of fiction is good.)
I think there's a lot of important, valuable critiques to be made about individual magic systems. Given how many of them revolve around individual accumulation of power, readers absolutely should be critical of authors who write those and don't engage with questions of power corrupting. Readers should engage seriously with the influences and conversation between different authors' magic systems. Readers should definitely judge magic systems that just aren't well designed, and fall apart with a little critical thought. And, yes, readers can and should judge magic systems that make their worlds feel smaller, more mechanical, less mysterious, and less fantastic. (That said, if an author set out to do that deliberately to explore questions like the shrinking of the world by communications technology, that could be pretty damn cool.)
After all, even though I firmly believe hard magic systems aren't inherently bad, many individual hard magic systems really are bad.
Likewise, I do think any author engaging in magic system building owes it to their creation to try and do it purposefully. We can't just rely on ""it's just your personal preference"" as a defense against hard magic system critics- we should engage seriously and in good faith with the best parts of their arguments, even steelmanning them if we have to, in order to whet our magic system tools sharper.
In the end, this post isn't going to solve the debate- mostly because folks complaining about magic systems often just haven't seen all the past complaints, hah. But even if I could end the debate, I wouldn't, because I find genuine value in the critiques.
Appendix A: The Boundary Between Aesthetic Judgment and Serious Critical Analysis
Alright, I should talk about this a little. Let's be real, not everyone's aesthetic opinions are equally valid. While I firmly reject the idea of objective aesthetic judgment, I equally reject the idea of purely subjective, relative aesthetic judgment. Some people have just thought more deeply and considerately about aesthetics, and others just... yeah. (I wouldn't put myself in the top percentiles, just to be clear, hah.) Aesthetic judgement is, in some respects, a skill that can be cultivated. Claiming that there's a point where aesthetic judgements, even the best ones, transition to critical analysis that is somehow more is going to be, and should be, a contentious claim- but one I'll stand by.
Writing is kind of a bad artform to discuss this boundary in, because every rule in writing can be broken with enough skill, so long as the reader still understands you. A better example might come from fashion- there's a ton of flexibility in the art, but there are some extremely strict rules out there. The clothing needs to actually work as clothing to still be clothing, for one- having the right number of holes, etc. And, on a more subtle level, there are rules for, say, the cut and drape of clothing that veer back and forth across this boundary, but absolutely have more validity as rules than claims about, say, how many adverbs an author should use. And then there's a further complicated level, that of socially determined standards. Many parts of what we understand as ""good music"", for instance, are highly cultural. In some societies, music that get played at funerals sounds happy and upbeat to Western ears. I think it's fair to say that learned cultural judgements require more extensive confrontation than individual opinions, regardless of whether you agree or disagree.
Serious criticism that goes beyond simple personal preference can run through any of these domains of validity, and others, and add significant value to consideration of and conversation about any artistic work. In fact, I'm very open to the idea that adding value to a work of art is itself that dividing line between aesthetic judgement and criticism. Of course, sometimes critics do just decide to die on a hill of personal preference- but damn if the best of them can't put up a spirited, amazing defense of that hill first, one that often serves to change a lot of minds. There are definitely critics out there (Elizabeth Sandifer, Jacob Geller, Dan Olson, etc) whose work I get excited about, and consider art in its own sake.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Just to chime in, I saw both sides of the Reddit war over this game both before and after it launched.
And what I saw was that a very small minority (the usual suspects, it seems, every subreddit has them) were flailing their arms over ""LGBT inclusion"" and how they ""don't want it in their videogames"".
But the overwhelming majority of dissent (especially regarding the leaks and early launch impressions) was more to do with narrative decisions, ""inconsistent"" character motivations, and the high level directorial choices involved in what the devs themselves acknowledged would be a ""controversial"" sequel. The first game was hugely beloved and cherished, so anyone who felt that the sequel was ""disrespectful"" of its predecessor in any way were not exactly silent on the matter.
Me personally, I don't really have a horse in the race, as I've only seen snippets of livestream gameplay, and I like to form impressions based on what I personally play and experience. But I just thought some clarification was necessary, as a lot of legit criticism around this game is too handily dismissed by people making strawman arguments like ""oh you're just sexist bigots who can't stand strong lesbian women in games"", when in reality only a very small vocal minority cared about any of that.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I love stories. I have been an avid reader and cinema fan for a while now, but video games are fairly new to me. I picked up gaming as a hobby during the first lockdown, and got truly invested in it after playing The Witcher 3. But I also see games more as entertainment than as art. Sure, there are some games I would undeniably consider art (Hellblade, What Remains Of Edith Finch, etc), but most of the (AAA) games I have played felt more like an entertainment product than something used by an artist to express themselves. And that is absolutely fine, but not entirely what I look for in media. However, this changed recently, after playing The Last Of Us Part II, and Disco Elysium.
Ironically, I 'hated' TLOU2 before playing it, because I somehow thought it was a good idea to trust the people in YT comment sections. But I decided to buy it anyways, simply so I could experience it. It blew me away. Not only is the presentation incredible, I found the writing to be stellar. On the surface it appears to be a simple revenge plot, but I think it's more about coping with grief and trauma, and finding meaning in your existence. It is incredibly nuanced, with borderline obsessive details, for example the symbolism behind the moth, and how the lyrics to every song played match what the characters are going through. I don't have the skill to write a proper analysis, so I would advice you to read this reddit post. This game is, besides RDR2, the first game I have played where it feels like the game was written by someone who is... cultured? That sounds pretentious, but most games simply feel like they are written by fans of Star Trek instead of Tarkovsky.
Then there is Disco Elysium, the second game in a row that blew my mind. The thought system is such an incredibly unique and brilliant system that it makes me wonder why no one created something similar before. Disco Elysium fully utilizes the medium's main aspect, interacitivity, to create a thought-provoking, profound experience. Reading is awesome, but creating your own character's personality and struggles is even awesomerder. Your thought's lines are terrific too, brimming with metaphors, vivid imagery, and substance. I'd say that every 10 minutes on average I came across a quote that made me look outside and reflect on what I'd just heard/read. Depending on what paths you choose, you'll come across themes such as existentialism, capitalism, communism, substance abuse, and many more, and all of those - at least those that I encountered on my playthrough - are explored in-depth, like you would expect in a piece of classic literature.
I don't even know exactly what I wanted to say with this post. I guess that I'm just happy that I have played these 2 games that aren't just great video game stories, but great stories in general. Games that I would undeniably consider 'high art'. Now, I am absolutely not claiming that these 2 (3 actually, Red Dead Redemption 2 is on that level aswell) are the only games of this quality, I simply haven't played any games like this. Games that have the power to not just entertain, but affect the consumer. Games that will leave a long lasting, possibly even life-changing impression.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"[SPOILERS AHEAD!!]
So there has been a loud group of people who bashed the game for all wrong reasons before the game came out and after the game came out for a short span. But since then fanboys of the game have been jumping on the love bandwagon towards the game and whenever they comment they depict the game as if it's the most perfect game of all time. They say like ""I don't understand why people don't like this game"" or ""I loved the story, what problems does people have?"" as if its the problem on the audience's part rather than the game's part. So here is the list of actual problems TLOU 2 has from someone who didn't hate the game, but didn't like it either.
NOTE: Bear in mind that I DIDN'T LIKE the first game at all. I hated Joel and i hate Ellie in this game because she is acting the same way as Joel(from First game) now.
-The game's message contradicting with the gameplay and sometimes, with the story itself::
So the game's message is ""revenge is bad"" or ""violence is bad"" or ""actions have consequences"" according to people(including me). All these messages are shown by the game but it just doesn't work since Ellie has to kill so many enemies while clearing out a level or when Ellie was gonna find Abby she killed so many of her friends and tortured them even though they hadn't done anything wrong to her. She killed so many people, and didn't face any consequences for it. And at the end(I am on Abby's side though) she let Abby go?? As much as I loved that she let her go, it didn't make any sense if she's gonna kill so many innocent people to find Abby and let her go just because she saw a flashback with Joel. Like c'mon, she should've faced consequences for killing tons of people on her way but she didn't. By doing this the game kinda tells how only Abby and Joel and Ellie are people with value and everyone else is just an obstacle you have to clear, so they don't really have any value.
-Characters::
Seriously, say what you want but this game failed miserably at doing characters the right way. Everyone felt off except Lev and Yara. Nobody had enough development to be able to feel for them. Many characters were also killed and THEN we got to spend time with them but by that point, I just didn't care because I know they're dead. Ellie felt like a dumbass who is blind for a revenge even though she knew Joel was wrong(and c'mon,we all know he had it coming). I just couldn't have sympathy for her. So you may know by now that I love Abby and hate Ellie. Joel was kinda redeemable in this game, though I certainly didn't really feel for him when he was beaten to death(he tortured and killed tons of innocent people in the first game, so why?).
So the only characters I actually loved throughout the whole fucking game were Abby, Lev and Yara. Everyone else felt bland, and that's the thing I don't understand. We had moments spent with them, the dialogues felt natural but I still couldn't care about them. They didn't have the magic that the characters of RDR 2 had. Or even the first game had( I know I hated it but the characters certainly had a charm that made us feel for them, in this game that charm just isn't there). Though I would like to point it out because many call it a criticism, Joel certainly wasn't out of his character when he said his name and location on Abby's place. He had changed a lot now, and it made sense. So that's an invalid criticism.
-Much longer than needed::
Yeah, I loved the gameplay(I loved the gameplay of the first game too) but seriously the story dragged so much longer than needed and there were enemies at every corridor I got fed up of the repetitiveness and tediousness of the gameplay. Also yeah, there were certainly a lot of parts that could be cut and it wouldn't make much difference. I don't know why devs do this. Even though RDR 2 is my favourite game, it felt too stretched out than needed, and this game did the same even thought the first game didn't feel like it had any fillers. This game had tons of fillers and after 20 hours I was wishing for the game to end.
-Not enough memorable moments::
Ending was the only memorable thing for me. The happy moments were there but certainly not impactful(Joel flashbacks were awesome though). They weren't as memorable as the giraffe moment from the first game or LENNNYYYYYY mission from RDR 2.
-Poor execution::
Many have said it already, but let me say this again that the story could've been much better if they had ordered the story parts in a correct manner. I can understand why many didn't like Abby. And killing off a character and then making us spend time with them? It really felt lazy. Joel's flashbacks were really good, he actually felt like a human being rather than a monster he was in the first game. But the flashbacks within flashbacks really messed my head. At a point I forgot what timeline I was playing because the game fucks up the timeline and pacing really badly.
-Out of place level::
The ending felt very out of place. Like Guarma from RDR 2. This gang comes outta nowhere in the end and they kidnap Lev and Abby and it was so Out of place it felt like they were there just for the sake of being there . Pacing felt a little bad too. Too many sections to clear out even though it was the end. I kinda liked the ending, since I now know Ellie is alone(she deserved worse, but okay) and Abby was left alive(she deserved much better) and it certainly made me feel empty. But that island level was just very bad.
FINAL THOUGHTS
Now the game had a ton of positives too. Its has great animations, great graphics, sound design, voice acting, but so does David Cage games which are far from Masterpiece. Gameplay was great IMO, and story was dull as fuck, but that doesn't mean this game deserved anything less than 5/10. It certainly doesn't deserve anything more than 8/10 too. It's a good game, but not a GOTY or GOTG material that people are making it out to be.
For me this game is 7/10, and for perspective I rate the first game 5/10. I loved it more than the first one.
But I need to give it to ND how they went for an innovative approach in game narrative(it's not really that innovative as movies and shows had been doing this for year, it's certainly a new thing in games though).
Also if anyone wants to know more legit criticisms with the game I highly recommend Skill Ups review, Moist Meter and Jimpressions of the game by Jim Sterling. All had legit criticisms that I fully agree with them. No ""SJW BADD!!"" or ""PROPAGANDA"" bullshit. Just actual reason why this game is just not as great as critics and fanboys are saying.
That's all.",0.6050292253494263
comments discussing gameplay experience,They will come in defending this game with some other thoughts that needs overly critical thinking.,0.6065567135810852
comments discussing gameplay experience,"So first, thanks for this detailed post. Now I'll challenge some points:
On consequences
Ellie does face consequences: she loses everything because of what she does. She gets traumatized. Not only does she loses Joel, her losses include Jesse, Tommy, Dina and basically everything and everyone she loved (or tried to). While, like the first one, the game does go for a blek hopeful ending, the bleak part is the consequence of it all: the beautiful happy life in the farm is now a desolate place and she is completely lonely because she decided to go after Abby twice. MAYBE they weren't the consequences you would have liked better, but I find it a bit strange that you didn't see them. Also you and I chose to kill those people. The game is nicely crafted in that most areas with infected HAVE to be cleared to progress, but most areas with human enemies you can (at least in hard and lower difficulties) clear without killing anyone or just a couple of people, so part of the gameplay in this game makes you choose to do the killing.
About characters I think your personal bias (as in the way you experienced the game personally) is tainting the opinion on character development. Of course the subjective part we can debate all day, and could get nowhere, so I'll limit myself to the most objective aspects: the ones that can't be denied of being present. You say that you didn't care for characters if you knew they were dead. I'm sorry for you if this is how you see the value of life and dead because everyone you know today will die and I sincerely disagree that that makes your interactions and time with them not worth it. Also I can't agree with thinking that memories of those who are dead are worthless but, as I said, I think that is a personal thing and if you think death basically erases all value we on't agree on this point at all haha nevertheless here I go:
Ellie isn't a dumbass. She is blinded by rage, but it is explained in both games: she's a kid that has basically being forced to mature through trauma. Of course losing the only one relationship that feels as family blinds her with revenge. This is further fueled by her self-hatred for being distant and mean to Joel. So while not ideal, this is very human. Saying it's dumb dismisses complexity that is both explicit and implicit in the game.
Nice that you felt for some of the characters and not others. That's how we experience stories, investing in some or other characters and plots. And the reason we like some and not others can be for bad quality, sure, but here is more proof of good writing: characters are differently written, all with complete arcs, motivations, flaws, etc. Why we don't like them all? Because we are not like them all and we don't like all people either.
I agree with you wholeheartedly that it wasn't bad writing for Joel to make a ""mistake"".
Pacing
Agreed with the length and pacing. The only part I didn't enjoy for its length but I will keep defending is Seattle Day 1 with Abby. It feels long and comes at a point where it seems to be the moment for an ending (Ellie and Abby finally meet! yay) but this drag is part of experiencing Abby, the ""so-hated Abby"" and it is needed.
Memorable moments
The memorable moments are certainly subjective. I loved and found memorable that first ride into the city with Dina, as well as a lot of others with Ellie and Abby.
Going full chronological with the narrative WOULD be the poor execution option. The memories are there for a reason in the moments they happen. Remembering Ellie lashed out at Joel at the party is much more impactful when it is remembered as almost the last words they said to each other, than putting it close to the opening scene and then having 30 hours until it matters, then redeeming it immediately with Ellie saying she'll forgive him would lose all importance instead of knowing it is pushing Ellie forward to abandon her happy family once more to go get Abby. This is the same with all flashbacks we get.
Playing with time and using it to tell a story is basic in writing: in medias res has being used in storytelling since forever (just talking about Western canon we have The Odyssey doing it precisely for this same effect). You have to put the parts in the order that relate to each other in the story and not just in chronological order. It's just like when you and I tell a story, we don't narrate perfectly from beginning to ending. Just like your post and my reply are ordered by topics and not plot order discussing scene by scene and encounter by encounter.
Also the game does provide clear information to the timelines: it says when things happen (which Seattle day or how many years ago) and even characters physique and clothes are different from one another. Also the whole color palette changes. It keeps getting darker in the present while the flashbacks are usually brighter and in different places instead of Seattle, places that do look different.
What else could they have done to hold our hands in those? Seriously asking. Beyond going B&W I can't think of anything.that isn't ridiculous.
I can understand how the California part feels weird. Pacing is indeed weird. But it would be even worse (no excuse for the bad pacing) to have a big city without any big/solid group. They make a nice job out of showing how there are more societies with their own ways that are tangential to the main characters. It's good worldbuilding (weirdly paced).
What did you dislike about the island? I'm curious since you didn't go into it and you're good at making your points so I'd like to know, since I particularly enjoyed going to the Scars island even if it was all burning most of the time.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I think the part that's frustrating for me as someone who loved the game (and also happens to write for a living), is that there's a difference between a narrative choice not working for you and calling a narrative choice ""terrible writing"".
u/brianstormIRL I'm not saying you're saying this as adamantly as other people I've seen, but the fact remains that a lot of people who are extremely against this game's narrative choices claim it has ""the worst writing ever"" and that's just not true.
This choice definitely worked for me, but I understand why it didn't work for others. I hated the switch to Abby at first, and looking back on it hours later, I love how I grew to feel about her as a character. Does this make me right and you wrong? No, not at all. People react to stories differently and that doesn't make the story ""good"" or ""bad."" On the other hand, there are legitimate ways to complain about writing, it's just a shame that with these highly divisive pieces of art (TLOU2 and The Last Jedi - another piece of bold storytelling I absolutely adored) it seems impossible for people to separate objective views and subjective views.
It comes down to amateur criticism becoming so hyperbolic that it's almost impossible to have a meaningful discussion. I think both of you ARE having a meaningful discussion right now, and that rules, but I see far too many arguments about this game that treat opinions as facts, and then narrative choices people don't agree with instead become ""sloppy, amateur writing and disrespectful to characters.""
It's fine to not like what happened in the story. That doesn't make the story bad.",0.6093832850456238
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Writing can surely be bad. It's easy to recognize bad dialogue, and legitimate plot holes (although too often people seem to think a plot hole = characters making mistakes or doing something they don't think they should do - but that's a whole different discussion).
This game made risky narrative choices and challenged player's perception of characters they've spent years becoming attached to. People are free to dislike those choices, that doesn't make the writing bad.",0.6084598302841187
comments discussing gameplay experience,Its definitely something I had to consider in light of that particular criticism but as I thought more about it the more fleshed out and consistent the concept of action and consequence is in the game,0.6321962475776672
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Let me start by saying someone can appreciate the game without being a fanboy. Your dismissal on your last line is a disservice to your argument.
Now, I will go point by point.
Gameplay vs Story - I feel you miss the point big, tbh. The gameplay is very congruent to the story theme: your killings are gruesome, they feel heavy and serious, people scream in pain and cry from fear of death. The whole time I played with Ellie, I dreaded what I was doing, because it was just so obvious how much pain she was delivering over a fucked up person that deserved to die, but one she loved. Yes, you kill a buttload of guys, but this is not Bioshock Infinite: there is no disconnection from your actions and the story: they come bite you in the ass, the same way your killing on the first game also has big consequences. So I must disagree with you in there.
Characters - This is very personal, and basically your opinion on how you relate to them. That said, I do agree with you on empathizing with Ellie. From the start, I didn't agree with what she was set to do. No one told her like 'hey, Joel was fucked up, he did a bunch of shit and this is long due'. It doesn't contradict with the story or characters, but it was weird to play on this quest of psycho revenge not even on board.
Long game - I may be getting old, but I had the same problem from the first game, and also most AAA games, so I don't feel comfortable criticizing this aspect. I get impatient, feel the need to rush the exploration to get to the end, BUT as said that is a personal issue. So meh.
Memorable Moments - Boy do I disagree with you. I think the most memorable moments were actually in gameplay: The first time you meet infected and humans on the red tunnels; Abby's entire day 2 is so fucking amazing, from the sky bridges to the amalgam, and to me, the most AMAZING and INCREDIBLE encounter was the first time you meet the Seraphites on the park, on Ellie day 2. Holy FUCK if that wasn't ABSURD storytelling and atmosphere through gameplay. I was on the edge of my seat with a clenched asshole. You can't see shit, the whistles are fucking terrifying, the lighting was top notch. Literally the best part of the game for me. Also, honorable mentions to the aquarium and the dinosaurs. They were not dull, but the giraffe is hard to top.
Execution - I don't have any beef with it, BUT cutting from the climax to the second half of the game was definitely bold, lol. Surely a justifiable complaint. Tho I don't think the ordering itself was the problem: seeing all those people you killed and tortured just living really got me laughing out loud, it was a very interesting way to guilt trip you. I don't feel it was lazy at all.",0.6232139468193054

comments discussing gameplay experience,"So something that stands out just from these comments is that a lot of people can’t actually agree on what the message is, which I think just speaks volumes on how the devs and writers executed the game. It’s not “revenge is bad blah blah blah” because Ellie doesn’t seem to change much until it’s far too late.
Now if you ask me I think they had a lot going for them, but the game just couldn’t figure out what it wanted to be. And the people involved seemed to be switching around way too many ideas. For example introducing the concept that Joel is really not a good person at all, that’s very good writing. But executed terribly because he gets killed too early and there’s not enough time to develop the antagonistic side of him.
Or take the Abby character for example, a really wasted opportunity imo. We go from playing as her, to watching her kill Joel, to then killing Jessie, then we spend like 9 hours with her, but then she brutalizes half the cast, and then we save her, but now she’s the final boss? It’s sooooo stupid and horrible writing. Like make up your mind Naughty Dog are we supposed to root for this character or hate her? Because you’re not making sense at all.
I also agree with you about how most of the characters are just pointless specially on Abby’s side. Manny and Mel are good examples. One of them spits on Joel’s face, but now he’s making jokes about getting drunk and watching anime. Um ok? Am I supposed to like this guy? Or the Mel chick, we see her get slaughtered by Ellie and now we’re supposed to care that she has some sort of friendship moment with Abby? No one will.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"I know you said the gameplay was good, and you liked the gameplay from the first game. I hated the gameplay in the first game. Is there anything that sets this game apart outside of the narrative?",0.6021921038627625
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Here's how I feel:
-It pulls stuff out of it's ass. Instead of letting the narrative come together naturally, they just add new elements willy nilly, like Ellie's last conversation with Joel, or the Rattlers just kind of existing. The plot services the themes, rather than the other way around, as a well-crafted story would. Hell, the original game did this really well, as the themes of how love can make us do terrible things. And yes, I know this game continues the theme
-Manipulating the audience. Instead of letting our emotions come as a result of the scene, it's almost like it tells us how to feel. We're supposed to see Nora's death as horrifying, even when Nora was kind of a bastard who outright mocked Ellie over Joel's death. Hell, even the advertising made us think Joel would live. As a side note, I can tell they wanted to subvert expectations, but if he did live, this would actually subvert our expectations in a really cool way. Hell, if Ellie died instead, I feel it'd be even more interesting.
-Going back on it's word. Neil outright said ""We don't use the word 'Fun'"" and yet the game is actually very fun to play. It comes across as a cowardly move to make the gameplay really good if they want us, the player, to feel like shit.
-Shielding against criticism. I hate ""Woke"" things, so this is kinda biased. But they added aspects of the game that are basically designed to incite controversy, so that anyone who actually criticizes the game can be called ""Transphobic"" or something.
-Trying too hard to be ""Serious."" The first game had a bunch of genuinely dark moments of that actually elicited an emotional response from me. None of them felt forced. Yet, with this game, we have some of the most comically edgy shit.",0.6061761975288391

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Have to disagree with you on the map front. I don’t think either game used it’s space particularly well. Exploring in XV is a little more rewarding, and I’d even say that towns were a million times more distinct. However, for that little bit more worthwhile that FFXV is, there is many fold more fluff. I would prefer XVI’s leanness, be it to a fault. I would rather not work as hard if 9/10 times, I’m going to end up disappointed anyway. Not to mention that because the gameplay is better in XVI, I come away not feeling so much like I wasted my time even if I don’t get a shiny new trinket from the ordeal.
Also, I think party dialogue is overblown and exhaustive. I would prefer that the characters had scripted world dialogue and discussed world occurrences and developed their relationships more when traveling, but I hate things like screaming what attack you/they are doing or post-encounter banter that you will have heard hundreds of times by the time you roll credits.

Personally, I think changing it to be on the entire node makes the most sense so players on something like 34.45.185.xxx would all get the spawn instead. This could also increase the number of servers they can run without affecting dclone hunting too much, thus relieving some of the server capacity issues, which happens to be the biggest complaint.

I was floored at how well they represented them. The audio, with headphones on especially, nailed it. The self doubt, the constant chipping away at what is real, the commenting on everything you do and the confusion it causes.
Obviously most people concentrate on the graphics, and I thought they represented the idea that you can't trust what you see pretty well, as well as just being stunning.
I did read one review of Hellblade 2 where they said the voices talking over dialogue was a problem for them. With this I guess it depends on how invested you are on them commiting to the bit and the experience. Because that is absolutely a thing, where someone is talking to you but its hard to concentrate or differentiate.
I'm about to jump into 2 and I'm very interested in how they carry this forward. The length is fine for me and the story is what's important, the puzzles and combat were interesting things to do between beats.

Wasn’t there recently a Tencent community guy that reached out to this sub? If anybody knows his username, tag him here.",0.6208865642547607

comments discussing gameplay experience,"This is really sad to see now. I remember when PUBG mobile first came out. I thought it was one of the best mobile games, because it delivered a quality game and didn't ask for anything in return. There was no shop. Then when the shop came out, I bought a pack to get the leopard print bandana. I got school shoes in the crate and realized the crates were completely pointless. But at least I supported the devs to get the bandana! We used to exclaim how they deserved the money for the quality we were getting. I stopped playing a couple seasons later, but it seemed that they were slowly shifting to the shop model. I had to click through 15 red dots just to get my screen to normal each time I came back to play a match or two, most of them advertising for some ridiculous skin. (Why are they all seemingly marketed to female characters as well? All your screen shots are of female characters if I am remembering correctly). Then I watched this sub complain about numerous glitches and hacks that are influencing their gameplay in a negative way. It's sad to watch the game devolve from a pinnacle of mobile gaming into another microtransaction filled piece of crap that has its gameplay neglected in favor of making a quick buck.
Well written, OP.",0.6100456714630127
comments discussing gameplay experience,"its not only about the transactions and microtransactions its also about the gameplay itself!! PUBG on PC feels so real! The concept of bots on mobile is so retarded! How many of you guys remember winning the first match on PC? now compare that to the number of players you killed on your first match in mobile and also your rank in the first match, the weaponry in the mobile version feels seriously underpowered ad glitched, sometimes a knocked players take more than a mag of an AR to go down! and those gunshot, vehicle, footstep sound markers!! Makes the game so unrealistic and easy! Bulletdrop is a way lot less and I also hate the fact that guns come fully loaded and ready to fire when you pick them up! Even an AKM withnjust 30 bullets in PC is enough to take out a squad with lev 2 gear but wtf PUBG mobile!?! even a single player isnt gonna die after getting knocked some times with 30 rounds of 7.62 let alone a full squad! All these need change!! We want no transaction, microtransactiok for limited time bs outfits! no lucky wheel with 0.001% chance of winning!! We want the similar experience on phone that you get on pc(if not better)!!",0.6029784679412842
comments discussing gameplay experience,Well said. And 2K upvotes. I usually see people defending Tencent when criticisms are posted. It's nice to see there are a lot of people who are tired of Tencent destroying the game. I don't know why this game has a 4.5 rating on Google Play.,0.6272289156913757
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Hey, this is a really high quality post. Thanks for making the effort to provide examples, context, and reasoned arguments addressing the issues you have with the game instead of the 99/100 other posts that touch on these issues but contain nothing more than worthless memes and whining.
The part about microtransactions / shopping experience made me curious about how PUBGM stacks up in this area next to other games in this genre. In my experience, PUBGM has never felt ridiculously overwhelming on this, but it's also by far my favorite mobile game, so I figured I'm biased. I did a quick experiment counting the number of pop-up microtransaction prompts a player receives upon opening a given game. This, of course, can fluctuate based on holiday/temporary events, etc., and I didn't count server selection which, in some games, comes before the game loads. It also doesn't judge item quality (subjective) or mention other problems, such as one of the games where these pop-up screens were untranslated from the original Chinese text, etc.:
PUBGM: 3
Knives Out: 4
Hopelessland: 5
Rules of Survival: 2 (this result surprised me - I know it has been 5+ in the past!)
Crossfire: Legends: 1 (also surprising... also Tencent)
MCVS: 4
Standoff 2: 0
Creative Destruction: 0
Not sure if the last two are anomalies or not. Anyway, I think this context is important when discussing the microtransaction criticism. Even when adding another tap to the process in PUBGM, like when the mystery crate drops every so often, I honestly have never felt like the pop-ups were impeding my ability to play in any major way. On the other hand, I specifically remember times when ROS had 5+ opening pop-ups and - even worse, in my opinion - the ""back"" or ""exit"" buttons to dismiss the pop-ups weren't in the same location for each pop-up, so trying to fast tap through them would inevitably open another store page or inadvertently begin a transaction.
separate shirt and jacket slots
I don't think it's fair to include this as an additional criticism of the game in the same post that criticizes microtransactions so heavily. Not only would splitting shirt and jacket slots add yet another resource per player for the game to load (thus potentially exacerbating the lag issue that some people experience) and could (for obvious reasons) be seen as just another attempt to find a way to get people to pay more for cosmetics, which is one of your main critiques.
Finally,
Tencent if you want to make a game where 100 strippers wearing slutty Halloween costumes bring their pets along to an island to kill each other with a weapon finish they paid $200 worth of crates to get, then make it.
This has always been the most perplexing complaint about this game for me. Mainly because I don't understand why so many people care so much about how other people choose to enjoy a game. Personally, I've never paid money/UC to open a crate. I've only used the scraps/tickets and I've bought the Royale Pass for 3 or 4 seasons (started playing at the beginning of Season 2). I only say this because I know some kid is going to chime in to try to troll me for buying cosmetics - I don't. BUT! If you spend $0 on this game or if you spend $200 per month on this game, the F's I give remain totally constant at ""Zero.""
Rarely do lobbies have any more than 2 or 3 players with absurd-looking costumes. If they put a helmet on in the match, usually the most absurd part of said costume goes away. If they don't put a helmet on in the match, they probably won't last all that long. I'd be annoyed by cosmetics if I was expecting to play a military simulation, but nobody who plays PUBGM has that expectation. It's just weird to me to be so perturbed by personal decisions other people make that have absolutely no effect on my ability in or enjoyment of a game!",0.60897296667099
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Great idea, go for it. Personally I appreciate that this kid took the time to articulate real, concrete frustrations about the evolution of the game shared by many long time players, and he did it without a bunch of angry personal anecdotes. It probably won't change anything, but people playing the game and talking constructively about how it could be better MIGHT eventually result in a slightly better game. Quitting pubg in protest will only result in you not playing pubg anymore.",0.642640233039856

comments discussing gameplay experience,"The climate of the subreddit is due to Bungie and their work. With that in mind most of these reviews are probably true.

And if you had bothered doing any research into ""pretty much every company ever"", you would know your closing sentiment is false - albeit some aspects are comparable to other AAA studios, there are definitely statements made that fit within the context and narrative of Bungie and Destiny exclusively.",0.6168764233589172

Pair all that with the fact that on it's face, the vocal majority online have only negative things to say.

I agree with you, other gacha games by the nature of the gameplay make them feel their characters a lot less unique and uneventful on their releases, specially if we are talking big rosters in the north of 100s total characters to pick from.",0.6024770140647888

comments discussing gameplay experience,"There's a few problems that I've witnessed. Number 1: genshin is the biggest gachq game on release and even surpasses Warzone in terms of concurrent players.
2: mihoyo is very stringent when it comes to rewards and free resources. This in tern makes an entire banner just feel utterly useless. ""Why did I grind for 2 months for kokomi if she's trash?"" ""Now I'm mad""
3: genshin impact is really the first game since Summoners War that has accumulated a non-gacha fan base. You have people like me who doesn't even like anime (not that there's anything wrong with it) and I still enjoy the game.
4: this one is probably reaching a bit and it's my own personal view. But I feel like the world in general has become absolutely restless. People are agitated, irritable, and just down right unsavory if you ask me. No more than 2 years ago if a dev from a game company got a death threat it was pretty big news. Now it seems like anyone tied to mihoyo is getting death threats left and right. Like it's no big deal. Idk, there's just no reason for people to get so up in arms over a video game like this.
People forget that it's alright to not have a busted character, a broken card, or OP weapon in games. Not everything is meant to be game breaking like ganyu. Or meta defining like zhongli. It's just like in fighting games. Not every character is going to be busted. With genshin impact it's almost silly to be sending death threats over a damn character because literally EVERY character is viable. It's a pve game. You could play dps Barbra and beat the entirety of the game. I'm rambling. But it just seems silly that people are so upset over characters not being ""broken"". I'll probably get downvoted for this but it's my opinion and I'm sticking to it, yes siree.",0.6066433787345886

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Mixed feelings, I'm sure with more clarity I'll be 100% onboard. Here's my thoughts.
Positives
-voice chat finally added
-specs are great
-backwards compatibility
-Mario Kart looks good
-third party games look good
-sharing games is cool
-007 teaser was well done
Not too sure yet
-video/sharing screen looked very laggy
-the mouse joy con looks like a poor gimmick and I don't think they will sell too many of the wheel chair basketball games (what were they thinking?)
-Mario Kart better have battle modes like balloon pop, bomb blast, shine thief etc.
-Why does Donkey Kong have pants now?
-Why are so many Mario Kart characters driving now, from fish and dolphins to snowman and crabs, they have no business being on a cart.
-price of games seems high right now. Mario kart at $80 or $90 (rumored physical copy price) is just too much
-Hopefully there is a full screen feature to voice chat; not really interested in my gameplay screen getting smaller to accommodate chat icons at the bottom
-Nintendo is at it again with lazy gaming, they already have 4 or 5 ""upgrade"" titles from the switch system. I swear Switches biggest fault was a lot of its library was just remastered or re-release WiiU/Gamecube/Wii games.
Still wondering if my Switch pro controllers will work on Switch 2",0.6022354960441589
comments discussing gameplay experience,"Okay, it seems a lot of the top comments point to folks feeling underwhelmed, and that's fair. But as a parent shopping for their kid, I'm cautiously optimistic. I have a 9 year old who has had a Switch Light for a few years, she wants to be able to play on a TV, and this comes out a month after her birthday. There's a good chance we'll be getting this as her belated big gift. She will lose her mind at being able to chat with her friends as she plays, because she can't do that currently.
So, for older kid-teen gamers and for adults, this probably feels like a catch up device so the features more match those of the competition. It's a good gaming device for a younger audience. I do hate the increasing cost of games, though. That said, I appreciate the game share option, so your kid could at least play a friend's game and know if it's something they'd want enough to justify the purchase. I also like how Nintendo's parental controls are generally far easier to manage than some other systems (PlayStation comes to mind, still on the learning curve on that one).",0.6372447609901428

comments discussing gameplay experience,"It's such a classic gamer comment. They like to go on and on about how games are works of art and should be taken seriously, yet at the same time they refuse to engage with them as you would with works of art, now claiming that they're just fun timesinks to fuel your escapism and shouldn't be taken so seriously. Like gamers are either unable or unwilling to see through even the thinnest layer of allegory and metaphor. Make a small, greedy, hook-nosed, big-eared creature that poisons your drinking water, then give it green skin and call it goblin, and suddenly gamers can't see the obvious Jewish stereotype they're presented with. ""Stop reading so much into it, it's just fun fantasy, jeez!""
Same with everybody's favourite apolitical gem, Skyrim. It has a dark-skinned population of refugees who live in a ghetto and are constantly being hassled by the local light-skinned authorities, being blamed for crimes they didn't commit just because of who they are, but because they got red eyes and pointy ears it's totally not about a real life population, stop trying to ruin my escapism!",0.6057188510894775

But I definitely agree that major rework of fauna behaviors and more emergent interactions with fauna, alien factions, sentinels, etc would go a long way towards making the universe feel more ""alive"".
I especially resonate with your point that most of the ""interesting events"" in-game arise from the player seeking them out, which can feel rote and programmatic, rather than the player just exploring and being confronted with situations they cannot easily ignore. Games like Dragons Dogma or even Skyrim are proof that you can respect ""player freedom"" without making the player so ""free"" that they have to consciously opt in to any form of incidental world content. Sometimes I'd just like the game confront me with some shit that requires engaging with a particular gameplay loop to deal with. So much of the game's best content is shielded away from the free roam experience; you gotta talk to a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy before the game decides you've triple-checked the boxes that then ""allow"" the game to present you with an antagonistic force.",0.6475458741188049

That sent me on an organic search to find a desert planet, then I warp into a system get attacked by pirates, fight them off and see a planet that looks too enticing to ignore so fly down. Its a lush green planet with red lakes and I decide I want to spend time here cataloging every creature.

comments discussing gameplay experience,"Brah, no offense, 8/10 needs to be read like a low B in this situation.  These aren't movie or music reviews where a 5 is average, they are game reviews that have always inflated the scores so about 8/10 is average.  This has been true for AAA videogames since at least the early 2000's when I first paid any attention to them.  Game reviews tend to be soft since they get a lot of bonus points just for being complete and functional.
All an 8 really means from most outlets here is that it functions well enough, checks the standard boxes expected of an AAA, and lasts long enough that most people won't feel short changed.
What's more, the reviews here are not all ""8's and 10's"".  As of this comment, it is averaging an 82, which suggests that there are plenty of 6's and 7's being given as well...which there are.
