comments discussing story of the game,I think the Isaac scenes are a good addition. He was hyped up quite a bit in the game despite not being very present. An earlier introduction to him and more development is certainly a plus for me. There’s other stuff that could’ve been cut out.,0.6079615354537964
comments discussing story of the game,I really wish they didn’t cut that. I know they’re trying to avoid it being a one to one copy of the game but what’s wrong with that if the games story beat was just that good you know?,0.6334556341171265
comments discussing story of the game,"Have you even read the criticism thread? There’s very little, if any, criticism there that isn’t sincere and honest and when there is people tend to voice their disagreements right away.

comments discussing story of the game,"I, for one, love the show. I’ve played the games four times each, favorite games of all time. I don’t understand why people feel like the show has to be exactly like the game. It can be its own thing and still capture the essence of the game. I feel like the show is doing that pretty darn well, and I honestly feel like a lot of people are just so fragile and “hurt” every time an adaption isn’t executed exactly to their liking. That’s not how adaptations work.",0.6018447875976562
comments discussing story of the game,"I really dont want any kind of association with the neckbeard sexists who bombed the game, bc PtII my favorite narrative arguably ever.
But the show has just not been doing the story justice. They clearly want to tell a different story and while thats not a bad thing, they should have just done a different story/different characters",0.653062641620636
comments discussing story of the game,The game was great but this season is missing the mark for me,0.6217039227485657
comments discussing story of the game,"I find it funny how the game fan threads and show only threads are night and day with response 😂
Personally, I think people are attached to the way the game told the story that they can’t accept the show. I don’t think there’s much substantive difference which is probably why show only fans tend to like it more. They have nothing to compare it to and can accept the story for what it is.",0.6474100351333618

comments discussing story of the game,"I think the epilogue only works because it wraps things up within the same game.

THEY told a story and in that made some bold calls and blew open the ceiling of narrative-driven video games. They continually impress with everything they put out, and as a fan of stories in general it was perfect. Having such a new gaming perspective of not “sit back and be the badass hero in the story” but “we’re gonna tell a dark story, force you to do some things you probably won’t like, then flip you on your head and ask you to think about everything.”

Recognizing the faults but making it clear that your personal opinion doesn't matter in the review context, because it's reviewing the quality of the medium; not your political bias.
Amazing how well a review can detail a game in what other companies take six to seven pages to write. Give me this every time. I don't care what some incel Christian thinks of the game or how ""bUfF cHiCkS aReNt ReAl"" or unrelated, but my personal favorite; ""wOmAn ShOuLdNt Be In WaR gAmEs ItS BrEaKiNg My ImMeRsIoN""

comments discussing story of the game,"What makes their opinion more valuable than anyone else’s? Because they work for Microsoft?
Their opinion is not more valuable than anyone else's. It's just more valuable than the army of salty fanboys who review bombed the game literally within hours of its release, where it was physically impossible to have finished the game.
But if you really want to know why these people deserve credibility, it's because their job is to specifically review games for the purpose of understanding why they're good (and bad). Their job is to inform Microsoft of the competition and instruct them on how Microsoft might be able to one-up them or at the very least match them. This review understood the game intimately, it seems, and was even more critical of its gameplay than most reviewers. They understood why it was so absolutely amazing and even gave advice on how developers might be able to steer their games in the future, narratively. This review was meant for internal use only and it had to be 100% honest. After all, why would Microsoft pay a team of people to review a game and lie about it? It makes no sense. They wanted to understand this game, and the team that reviewed it gave their most professional and honest opinion.",0.6269152164459229

Part of the message of the game is questioning the straight ""following along"" of the plot and the violence that occurs. It's not about answering that question, but just highlighting it.
As well, it was a commentary on the typical shooter games that were somewhat flooding the time, and perhaps the typical campaigns tacked on with them. Really, Spec Ops: The Line is about its meta-commentary, not the story.",0.6074481010437012

comments discussing story of the game,"Most interesting thing to me is that unlike the first one the gameplay seems to be the most universally praised aspect of the game, with the majority of the lower reviews mentioning messy narrative decisions that bog down the experience.

But if we want to accept that games can be art, then we need to accept that games reviews can exist as art critique, and that's what Polygon appears to be doing.

The hand to hand is so grounded and immersive the dodge mechanic is rlly well placed and the immense variety of animations and combos is unreal i am on the 2nd play through and have seen many that i did not see before The stealth is one of the best out there to lying under truck or lying in grass the animations look so smooth they nailed it it all feels like ome big set piece and npcs feel smart they dont just stand there they interact with stuff they look around, if they are talking from a distance and u kill one of the people mid sentence people will investigate as to why he stopped talking also dogs are a new addition and makes the game even more tense Visuals/sound: One of the best if not the most gorgeous and detailed games out there the various landscapes are all stunning and compelling, each are that u come across looks unbelievable so detailed. The sound is something naughty dog always nails and they haven't with part 2 either Overall i think naughty took a risk in story and alot of people didn't like it along with the leaks thag put people off game leaks with no context the game is worth a try to judge for yourself and not jump on the bandwagon like so many are its truly a masterpiece one of the best games os this generation and a great sequel dark intense sequel that makes you feel so many emotions and they accomplished what they wanted",0.6008931398391724

comments discussing story of the game,"Rather than writing a long response I'll just steal the opinion of the commenter above and build from it. While I concede that most of your analysis is logically sound if we agree with your basic principles and definitions, I do believe that basis is built on views and interpretation of terms that are let's say, niche to specific feminist circles. So I don't think feminism was what Team Cherry designed the game as being about. What I mean is that, as a writer, I'm sure a future reader of my own comics could totally make a detailed analysis about how my story is actually about feminism. And while I care about many things like female representation, no it was not my intention. However I do believe in the inherent value of personal interpretations, no matter whether ""correct"" or not. The opposite would be rich from someone who made 5 video essays on feminism in Kill la Kill. So yours was an interesting read indeed.

comments discussing story of the game,"incredibly well formed analysis, but i think even in your own analysis you seem to contend with the fact that feminst themes are not necessarily the central one of the game. personally though, i think your analysis really shed some light for me on how feminist themes do play into the central message of the game, specifically in the termination of generational maternal trauma, especially as a metaphor for capitalism. throughout the game the way gms created the society, and crucially the citadel and underworks areas of pharloom is shown to be intertwined with her children, the weavers. herrah breaking free from the cycle of abuse and hornet carrying that on is literally how hornet becomes a better version of herself and makes the society of pharloom better.
ill take the time to write a full analysis later, but before i go id like to note that as per your comment on english not being your first language you have fluency and command of english i only see from those who have closely studied its craft. your tone is clear and mellifluous, and your prose is concise and direct in a way that shows the immense effort you've put into it. additionally your formatting and grammar indicate a level of perfectionism suited to higher platforms than reddit, and i'm not sure your technical skill level would be completely out of place in the annals of famous novelists and poets; it's very well constructed is my point.",0.6092544198036194

I only have two criticisms, which may have just stemmed from english not being your first language as you said, but I believe you mean ""feminity"" as opposed to ""feminism,"" as a major theme in the game. The criticism of capitalism is there, but it appears to be more of a criticism of greed and industrialization, not inherently capitalism. Alternatively, I was thinking ""late stage capitalism"" is more apt than just capitalism.

I swear Factions wasn't this big of a deal back in 2013 but now it seems to be the hill to die on. I also feel like the gameplay and graphics comments are at best made with rose tinted glasses and at worst are just disingenuous. I mean just look at the Digital Foundry tech review. Not only are the graphics basically remade with models, world and effects being improved but also the cutscenes down to the directing and camera angles of the scenes, not to mention they are completely real time now. The gameplay also seems improved with better AI and changes to the physics and gunplay. While Joel isn't diving and dodging around like a madman in conveniently placed patches of high grass it's still an improvement.
Now, I'll admit 70€ is a bit steep but to call this just a cash grab isn't fair to Naughty Dog. It is a cash grab in the sense that it costs money (crazy, huh?!) and the PS4 is cheaper but it also seems to be the definitive version for a critically acclaimed single player story with real work and care being put into the game.

comments discussing story of the game,"The first game was clear on that with the DLC though? It was them being pissed off about Joel getting killed and the transphobia around Abby. One of my highest rated comments was in a post showcasing that spoiler and I remember the absolute outrage when people confirmed it was real footage. Then we got hordes of posts about how a girl's body can't look like that, she must be a man, protein powder and constant workouts can't give a woman that kind of body, etc etc.
The main reason I can remember is because my complaint wasn't about either of those things but because right wingers and transphobes were all over anything that didn't praise the game, they latched onto my comment. (For the record, my comment was about Druckmann saying if he made TLOU2 it would be about new characters and that Joel and Ellie's stories were over. I think when you have a world as big as this, it's more enticing to see what is going on elsewhere than falling back to the safety of established characters. I would've been happy if we spent 90% of the game as Abby and had a surprise final showdown with Ellie where you got clues of what happened but it really clicked then. I would've been happier if we never saw a tie to Ellie or Joel ever again.)",0.61323481798172

comments discussing story of the game,"I know he did go on record in a video saying he “didn’t even want to play it anymore” after he saw the leaked footage. I dunno whether his perspective has changed after considering the game as a whole, but since he was so quick to write it off without seeing the finished product, I’m leery of what he will have to say. Wouldn’t be surprised if he never gave it a fair shake. But maybe he ended up liking it, or maybe it wasn’t for him but he will still have a fair and constructive analysis to share.
The thing with most YouTube “reviewers” is that they are first and foremost entertainers. Even ones I agree with in general, I take their reviews with a grain of salt. And while Joe has been around a long time, he really goes all in on the entertainer angle with skits and over the top reactions. So I wouldn’t put too much stick in his review regardless of whether it i positive or negative.

comments discussing story of the game,"His review is out already and it was exactly what was expected.
It's not bad at all, he does give out some fair points for why he didn't like it but at the same time I just can't really fully consider his opinion when he clearly went in it with an almost fixed mindset after the leaks and the way he seemed to be unwilling to actually give it a chance.
He does present some fair argument against it and I understood most of it but he also goes on this rant about how basically everyone knows better then the people who actually created the characters about what the plot could've been and It's kinda funny to me because pandering to the ""woke community"" would have been outrageous which is proven by the reaction and how everyone jumped into assumptions after the leaks but had they made a fan service story, had they played it safe and made something to satisfy fans wants instead of the story they wanted to tell (aka pandering) that would have been 100% okay.
At the end of the day, I understand and can definitely see why some people didn't or won't like the story but saying this game had lazy writing and basically going on and on about how they should've done what the fans wanted is just not a valid argument for a reviewer who should have the capability of being objective and rational in my opinion.
He also contradicts himself sometimes. I mean, 6/10 is a fair rating... had he not spent 90% of the video pointing out all the wrong things they did and barely mentioning what he thought they did right. Hell, he even says in the end that gameplay was one of the things they did well yet earlier in the video he's going on about how they've only added prone...
I really do like AngryJoe but rarely does he give a review where he actually has an opinion that differs from what is the most vocal one, especially amongst his fans and community.",0.6093689203262329

They had a really hard task and I definitely agree that if they had indeed done a lot of what people have been saying they should've done instead, they'd still get backlash anyways hence why I think doing what they wanted to do with the story even with all that weight on their shoulders was the right choice.",0.6059064865112305

comments discussing story of the game,"Angry Joe came out with his review. He gave it a 6/10. 5 years from now these review scores are going to look like jokes when the culture wars over this game dies down.
A game that has this many industry leading aspects from animation, voice acting dialogue writing, atmosphere, combat movement, stealth gameplay etc getting a 6 just because you disagree with story direction is silly.
Another thing he doesn't realize is how much of an influence he is to the gaming community. 15-25 year olds are his core base and that age group has issues with thinking for themselves. They latch on to influencer opinions. Angry Joe for all his hatred of monotization, lazy publishers etc is going to influence the gaming industry to push out generic trash and not take risks.
What's even more sad is if the leaks didn't come out where a multi-month campaign by alt-right YouTubers didn't spam hatred for the game making it the mainstream narrative amongst young YouTube viewers based on the leaks, Angry Joe would probably be praising this game. Notice how he waits weeks after the game releases to see how other YouTube channels are being treated by the audience based on if they praise or hate the game.

comments discussing story of the game,"Just finished playing this game — So now I can finally read all the discussions and watch reviews without spoilers.
I'm in the ""this game is a masterpiece"" camp so I may be biased but from what I can gather from most of the negative fan reviews I would hazard the guess that these boys aren't much of the ""reading"" types that value literature let alone understand complex character development and critical thinking. If these guys actually paid attention and enjoyed the typical books assigned in literature classes we would see a lot more thoughtful reviews (which does not mean you can't criticize the game) instead of ""I hate that they killed Joel! Abby bad! Foot stomp! Hmph!"" They probably also hated Romeo & Juliet because of the (spoiler alert) double suicide at the end and all the ""irrational"" decisions that led to that ending. Life isn't logical or rational, people are flawed and we all have the potential to make poor decisions in the heat of the moment. Heck, I still hold a grudge against a pizza place from 15 years ago that had an employee that was rude to me...

Bf seemed to dance around it in a way that wouldn't offend anyone while GF was a little more pointed about it. There aren't ""two sides"" to homophobia and trans hate.

If anyone doesn't like the game solely because they play as a woman, a gay woman, a buff woman, or because it has a trans character...you're a phobe and a dick and you shouldn't have a platform to spew hate under the guise of ""not agreeing with the lifestyle""
and for the reactionaries that are gonna jump and accuse me of saying people who don't like the game are phobes...no, that's not what I'm saying. Disliking the game is perfectly valid. Hating that Joel died..valid. Disliking the structure that forces you to play as the antagonist for a significant chuck...valid. the fucking need to pickup so much little shit...valid. There's lots of reasons, many I disagree with, but you know it's just a videogame and discussion is healthy, but plenty of valid reasons. There's criticism and disappointment.

They shouldn't be afraid to take a strong stance anyway since the game is breaking all sorts of records in sales too.

comments discussing story of the game,"I think the major part of this diversion is caused by way too high scores from game critics. Let alone controversial story, the game has little to no improvement to the 1st one gameplaywise. It's still a solid game, but can't be called perfect. And when every critic shouts about its perfection, natural reaction is to destroy it with hate to give potential buyers a sign that not everything is great. Like when your pass is blocked by a piece of cloth, hiding linier level structure in 2k20. Plot also has lots of holes and driven by narrators desires to show certain scenes and not the logic of events, and when your game is all about the story, one can get nitpicky about it. And critics haven't done that. So I believe that it's not the game that earned itself such low user score, but critics' hypocrisy. It's a solid game, but no near to being perfect.

No other publisher would just get a free pass for something like that. Having to review a story-driven game without mentioning the story is like reviewing DOOM without talking about the gameplay. I think it is sincerely disingenuous to give a game with such a deeply flawed narrative a 10/10 when that's what people are there for.

comments discussing story of the game,"The game definitely had some pacing issues
And marketing it as Ellies Story and then playing so much as Abby is a very real flaw that I think kicks the game in at a 9/10 TOPS
But reading through all these top comments, and tone and language they use, seems like people are just ragging on the game because they dont like that Joel died.
And since that's too obvious of a 'salty' opinion they are blowing other minor flaws out of proportion
Joel's death was fine. A little tropey and expected, buy what isn't tropey...? It makes sense that the daughter of the doctor Joel killed would want revenge - and having been a hopeful firefly who lost her pack, she had nothing to lose.
My main issue with playing as Abby, after getting past the issue of the game being billed as Ellies Journey, is the same issue I had with the first games Winter segment
You spend all game building up your character with upgrades and loot, just for it to be taken away - and when you finally return to that character, you only have a handful of encounters left before the game is over.
Ultimately, gameplay should be king when discussing a video game, even one that sets out to be a movie quality narrative. Anyone rating this well made game under an 8, or acting like some 10s are unwarranted while games like MGSV and BotW got tons of 10s from the industry, are just salty kids who like to hate on popular stuff - and reading through peoples reasonings, I'd wager didnt even play the game themselves but are basing their opinions of leaks and the opinions of others.",0.6256615519523621

comments discussing story of the game,"I’ll avoid spoilers.
I completed it over the weekend and I think its a masterpiece. I’m astonished that people are having such negative reactions to it. I guess a lot of die hard fans just don’t want to accept what happens in the game, which I understand. But I really hope that those fans can look past their initial reactions and really see what this game achieves, because I truly think it is peerless in its craft. If you come at it with an open mind, an open heart and a strong stomach, you’ll be enriched.
It’s not a story about revenge, or a pandering morality play on violence - it’s about trauma. How it lingers in you, how it can define and destroy both alliances and enemies, how it is rationalised (“revenge”, “justice”), how it refuses to leave one’s body, and how deeply dehumanising it is.
The ending gave me that same sick, cold feeling in my stomach as the first game’s ending, where I hated what was happening, but couldn’t truly condemn it because I understood where it was coming from. I think fans who can’t get past their initial reaction...they’re missing out. This is a story told with a level of emotional maturity and honesty you rarely see, except in perhaps the first game.
But try telling that to anyone who has had their heart broken by the game and has already made their mind up...people like Ellie.",0.6113804578781128

Numerical scores on reviews need to go in their entirety. Make people actually read them But reading this thread is exhausting. Every time there’s a big game. It’s the same type of comments
Backlash, counter backlash,
people only hate it for some lgbt/race reasons because gamers are all apparently incels

I feel like we're heading towards some sort of major turning point when it comes to crunch culture, like some sort of major controversy where we find out Rockstar has been holding its employees' families hostage during the production of GTA 6.
As far as the story goes I'm not sure if I'd be a fan were I to sit down and play it. I'm really not big on the whole ""remember this totally insignificant character? Yeah well you killed them and now their kid is out for revenge"" trope. Especially since you literally could not progress the game without killing that scientist in the ending of the first game, so it's sort of like you're being punished for completing the game.

As someone who's seen the game played all the way through I think it's a decent game with some noticeable issues (none of which are the existence of lgbt people, brown people, or women who dare to have biceps). Certainly not 10/10 material but not a dumpster fire like band-wagoners would have you believe either.
It's unfortunate that the review bombing and transphobia/homophobia (seriously, don't go to /thelastofus2. the rampant hatred spewed at minorities is ridiculous) make having genuine discussions about the game's actual issues difficult. Especially in regards to the irl poor treatment of employees at naughty dog.
On top of crunch I've heard from several different people that the developers were made to use actual images/videos of mutilated bodies as reference in the pursuit of realism with the game's violence (though I can't provide concrete sources for the rumors). Regardless, as tech increasingly approaches more realistic depictions I think this will become a more urgent problem in the gaming industry, with people having to embrace subject matter than can inflict real world harm to the psyche in pursuit of art or a paycheck.

comments discussing story of the game,"This drama isn’t less than two weeks old so much as on-going for years. The review bomb is due to all the factors I set forth - The LGBT representation incited homo/transphobics to hate on the game, some rejected the game finding this representation not having been done properly, some bombed it due to the leaks which showed a game many were unhappy with for one reason or another, some may still have had residual feelings against Naughty Dog due to the expose that came out, some may have had hate against Druckmamm for the Hennig departure - which IS a thing - I mean, this post is a list for the storm of bad things that occurred around this game’s development. Yes it’s two sides yelling at each other, but there’s no one factor to cause it, its the lot of them. And yes, many of the reviews didn’t finish the game, that’s the point of a review bomb - people who don’t play a game give it low ratings for external reasoning.

Is public perception relevant? Sure, if you want it to be.
Is public perception multifaceted and complicated? Sure. A ton of, maybe most of the criticism is coming from overgrown children mad about muscles or something. And some is coming from people who just genuinely don't like the game for perfectly okay reasons.
Are the opinions of professional critics relevant ever? Fuck no. They're clowns with very close relationships with publishers. Games journalists are punchlines for a reason.

comments discussing story of the game,"Thank you for this writeup by the way. It's obvious you put real time and work into compiling and writing all of this.
That quote explains a lot. It is a divisive concept. That games don't need to be fun. As game makers strive to make an artistic impact I think the debate will become even more prominent. I mean in Film, Requiem for a Dream, and Moonlight are both beautiful artistic achievements. Neither of them could really be described as fun. Also though neither of them ask for thirty hours of active participation.
If people prefer to see something uplifting, prefer to be excited, prefer to be entertained that's perfectly fair. If someone wants to spend their time at the movies watching Fast and the Furious instead of Parasite there shouldn't be shame in that.

You think the only way NOT to legitimize them is to ""alter the facts in your post?""
That's some mighty odd framing you've got there.
And my post is just saying what happened during this entire thing, if that gives them legitimacy... okay?
Also, you may think you're being objective and to that I'll say two things.
There is bias even in terms of what ""facts"" you CHOOSE to include and exclude and how you present those ""facts.""
Being ""objective"" doesn't absolve one of any and all responsibility with regard to the consequences of your actions, at least not necessarily.

comments discussing story of the game,"hey, can't deny that. This was the first episode that I felt like, while i was watching it at least, I kind of disassociated from myself as the person who had played the game and was like ""this was fun"". I think after 3 episodes of being kind of annoyed it was getting to a point where I either had to give in or stop watching it, and i love TLOU too much for the latter.
I totally get what you mean though about it being well-performed. That's been a constant struggle with this show for me. A great example is the line from the final episode of S1, the hilariously on the nose, tell us Joel's whole character arc in a single line, ""It wasn't time that did it"" conversation. From a writing/storytelling perspective, god i hate that line. But the interaction between Bella and Pedro is just portrayed so beautifully that it kind of tricks me in the moment. If I examine it at all, I go back to hating it, but every time i see that clip, it draws me in.
I think that overall, that's probably the greatest magic trick the show is doing. They've hired such amazing actors, who have this backbone of such a great narrative with occasionally great writing (like everything with Isaac this episode was wonderful. The subtlety of him talking about how dehumanizing ""voters"" is to him casually calling a Seraphite a ""scar"" to their face was really excellent i thought), that it can kind of draw you in at times, and forget that it coulda been better.

comments discussing story of the game,"Per my fics: thank you so much, that's awful kind of you to say.
And i absolutely respect your differing opinions on these, and if i'm completely honest, they're probably a little more fair than i was being, or at least giving the writers more credit than i am. I think the only thing I would say is, like with Dina and Joel's relationship, or Dina still going for Ellie, I guess I would have just liked to have actually seen that a bit more (and maybe we will with Dina and Ellie there in Seattle). I think that sure, the way you're reading Dina and Joel can be inferred, but taken at face value (which is always dangerous and risks being accused of not having media literacy), he's calling Dina his nickname for Ellie. He's watching the movies with her he watched with Ellie in the games. Etc etc. Things like that made it feel to me like replacement rather than a different kind of relationship.
I fully admit though that I have a strong bias here, and even though it's an adaptation and deserves to get to make its changes, i was really hoping their relationship would be one of the things that emerged completely untouched, and i'm having trouble letting go of that now that it's clear that's not what's happening.
Also, really great insight into the different personalities of the writers and how that's coming through to how they write the characters. A+ work just on your whole comment in general, i'd happily read a long analysis from you about the show/game.",0.618260383605957

comments discussing story of the game,"First of all, I wanted to say your point of view was very interesting and beautifully written.
Also I would love to read your fanfic!!! What's the title?
I absolutely understand your perspective, I also think that Ellie and Dina in the game are presented as more mature and better equipped to handle different situations, which is reflected in their relationship. It is far more grounded at this stage in the story compared to the show. They def feel like ride or die very quickly. The fact that they get together on the day of Joel's death makes for a heart wrenching contrast, she gains this beautiful, loving relationship, while she goes through the worst loss of her life. I also appreciate your comment about it being a factor in their relationship, this sense of guilt that haunts her, I couldn't have worded it better if I tried.
However I feel more hopeful than you towards their relationship in the show. I think it's a very realistic representation of how people their age navigate through those romantic feelings. With changes of the timeline I believe they can still build a solid foundation for their relationship, it doesn't have to happen right this moment, it just has to be strong and convincing before Ellie's departure to Santa Barbara. I think in a TV show the creators have more time to explore their feelings and show us their connection compared to the game.
In the game they wanted to establish their relationship before they arrive to Seattle, so that we (as gamers) can be thrown into the action and focus on the gameplay. Later they only have time for the cutscenes where characters comment on certain events of the story and plan their next steps, so they didn't have as much time for exposition as they have in a show. I think the creators want to have fun with this new freedom that the show provides. Also there's a question of how many scenes Ellie and Dina will have in Season 3, which probably will favor Abby's story more, but it would be smart to throw some scenes to keep the audience engaged in their story. So maybe that's also a reason for this ""slow burn"".",0.6117051839828491

comments discussing story of the game,"this IS the same whiskeytango! That's so incredibly touching of you to say.
I agree wholeheartedly with your whole post. The show is really leaning into them being just teens, and I think that feels like a misunderstanding of the world of the game. In the game, sure, they are the dictionary definition of teenagers, but they are adults. Young adults sure, but still adults. They have both been through so much in their time. Dina was 10 when she first killed, Ellie 14, and they've done a lot of it since. They exist in a world where, even within the safety of Jackson, they do not get to be teens like people right now do. They are a step away from being child soldiers, being out on patrol to protect the town from the time they're at least 16, but probably younger going by how quickly Ellie writes about trying to get on group patrol.
All of that to say, because they feel more adult, their relationship also feels more adult. There's a feeling of far higher stakes and intimacy than of a teenage crush. For some reason, I imagine maybe because Mazin has kids around their age, that they're now being written like they're kids, kids from our time period and circumstances, and man... it's deflating to the weight of their characters.
Actually honored to read your words again.
That's crazy nice of you to say. I don't want this to turn into me doing a ton of self-advertising, but I do want to say that since I haven't written anything but those two fics, i've decided that I want them to be the best they possibly can be, so in the last couple months I've been working with a professional editor friend of mine to do kind of a ""remastered"" version of them. Been adding new chapters, punching up the writing, and just trying to overall heighten them. I suspect I'll be done with it in the next couple months, and then am going to update the stories on ao3, so i guess just watch that space.

Personally, I love reading posts like this, people sharing how they experienced the story, especially when their opinions or emotional responses are completely different from mine. So if you've written something similar, please share it. I'd love to read it!
For Part II, I wanted to do things a bit differently. While playing, I kept a file where I wrote down some thoughts, reactions, things I shouted at the screen, stuff like that. I thought about sharing that file but it's really freaking long and I don't know who would actually want to read the entire thing… I mean, I would, but I'm kind of weird like that. I'll be quoting parts of the file, hopefully, you'll find it interesting, or at least entertaining :)
Even with my notes in front of me I know I'll miss things, I'm reading through them now and there's so much random nonsense. It's kind of funny, I wrote down tons of thoughts and reactions, but there's zero context. No chapter titles, no locations, nothing.
It took me 15 days to finish the game, way longer than it should've. I didn't check my final playtime, but the last time I played as Abby I was at 23 hours so I'd guess around 24-25 in total. I could've finished it in a couple of days but there were sections that were just SO scary I'd freeze up. I would sit there staring at a door I was too scared to open, then end up scrolling Instagram for an hour and suddenly it's 1 AM and I have to sleep. That's how I ended up only playing only 1 or 2 hours per day. 
Just something to keep in mind while reading, quotes in italic ""Like this"", are my own thoughts that I wrote down while playing, quotes in bold ""Like this"" are direct quotes from the characters. Anyway, enjoy :)
DAY 1 - Jackson

Prologue
Joel's conversation with Tommy about the hospital, those cinematics hit way harder this time. Maybe because in Part I I was too focused on the gameplay and the shock of the ending, but hearing it all laid out again really landed emotionally.
Right after, we step outside into this absolutely stunning place. Jackson already looked great in Part I, but now, in golden hour lighting? Gorgeous. Of course I took some screenshots. I have to say, Part II was so intense and plot-heavy I ended up taking way fewer than I did in the first game.
Back in Ellie's room, the tension between her and Joel is obvious, and it's understandable after what happened in Salt Lake City. Still, the moment ends on a really sweet note. Joel playing and singing for her, then giving her the guitar. That got me emotional.
Waking Up
""4 YEARS LATER"". We wake up as Ellie, and I did not expect that kind of time jump, ""Omg look at you!! All grown up, she's soo cuteee"".
We're introduced to Jesse through a pretty awkward convo:
""She kissed me"", and I'm like ""WHAT??""
""We break up for a week and you make a move on my girl?"", ""Excuse me?? Your girl?? What is happening?? Oh he's mad"".
""I'm messing with you"", ""so.. we're cool? Okay"".
We find out Ellie has a journal, and I love it. Such a great addition, you get a glimpse into what she's really thinking, the stuff she doesn't say out loud. It adds so much depth.
As we walk through town, we run into the old asshole who made trouble the other night, whatever, and then we finally meet Dina. She's gorgeous. The conversation about what happened last night is a little awkward, but then we team up and absolutely destroy those kids in the snowball fight. 10/10 moment.
The Overlook
We meet two new characters, Abby and Owen, and my immediate reaction is: ""Who the hell is she?"" and ""Damn, she's buff"".
It was already pretty clear to me that these people weren't up to anything good, and I had really mixed feelings about it, ""I don't want to play as the bad guys"".
We move forward, clear a couple areas, try out the new mechanics, cool, please give me Ellie back.

Patrol
The game answered my prayers, we're back as Ellie, out on patrol with Dina. Loved this part. There's a bunch of great interactions between them, and we even find out Joel's into old action movies, who would've guessed? I really love how these little details keep adding layers to the characters. When we reach the supermarket and Dina says, ""Spores, masks on"" and it suddenly hits me, these people have no idea Ellie is immune.
After the chaos in the supermarket we lose Dina in the storm and I was genuinely terrified, thinking something way worse was coming. Luckily, it wasn't. We find shelter, the whole scene in the grow room? Easily top 5 Part II moments. Weed and sesbian lex? Let's goo.
DAY 2 - Jackson:
The Horde
We're back as Abby, ""Ugh"". That horde of infected was terrifying, I wasn't expecting something like that at all. I was sprinting for my life, absolutely screaming, ""WHA- WHO’S- JOEL??? TOMMY?? HOLY SHIT"", stress levels through the roof.
Back to Ellie and Dina, still enjoying themselves. And Ellie's tattoo?? I want it. I need it. At the time, I thought it was wild that Ellie just casually told Dina about the bite, just like I expected Dina didn't believe her. Then Jesse showed up with bad news and just like that, the fun was over.
Back to chaos, the three are still running from the horde, they make it inside the chalet, and things start to feel... off.
Tommy introduces himself and Joel to Abby's group, when Joel says his name? You could feel the tension. It was like the whole room froze, I felt like I was actually there.
This part... this part was something. Back when I wrote my post about Part I, I thought I had it all figured out, ""It's going to be this amazing story about Ellie growing up with Joel, going on cool, dangerous, emotional adventures, some setbacks for sure, I mean, it's a post-apocalyptic world, but nothing too wild"", was I wrong.
Abby shoots Joel in the leg and I start screaming ""EEEEEHHH?? WHAT THE FUUUCKK???!?!"", ""OH MY GOD, HIS LEG, HIS LEG IS COMPLETELY FUCKED UP"", ""WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?! THEY JUST SAVED YOUR ASS"" I couldn't stop. I was yelling the whole time. Abby steps back, and I think, ""Okay… okay. She's going to torture him, interrogate him. She wants something. By the time she's done, Ellie and the others will be here. They'll save him. It's going to be fine"".
Back to Ellie, she's racing toward the chalet, yelling Joel and Tommy's names And I'm yelling at her like, ""Girl, LOWER YOUR FUCKING VOICE"".
She gets inside, heads downstairs, opens the door. And there's Joel. On the ground. Covered in blood. Barely conscious.
I start screaming again, ""SHOOT THAT FUCKING BITCH"", Ellie gets tackled, they are holding her down and she's screaming the exact same things I am, ""YOU'RE GONNA FUCKING DIE"", ""I'M GONNA KILL YOU"", and so on.
The scene is overwhelming. My heart's pounding. I'm panicking.
Owen says to Abby, ""You're done"", and I think, ""Okay... Joel's still alive, he's hurt, bad, but he's going to make it. We've been through worse, we'll get through this, we always do, right? Right, Joel?""
Abby looks down at him, she tightens her grip on the golf club and me and Ellie are begging the same exact thing, ""No. No no no. Please stop. Please"".
She strikes him one final time.
I stop screaming. I just let out one long gasp, then silence. I stared at the screen in total disbelief. Not even crying yet, just pure shock. This felt like the kind of thing that happens at the end of a story, not just a couple hours in. Everything I thought this game would be was shattered. I paused the game.
The next scene, Ellie sitting on her bed staring into nothing, that was literally me, just sitting there, silent, for 20 minutes, trying to process what just happened. ""This can't be real, right? They'll save him, rush him back to Jackson, treat him..."" Then a knock at Ellie's door, ""JOEL??"" How naive. No. It's Tommy. And he brought food. That's when it hit me.
Joel's dead.
He's actually fucking dead.

Packing Up
This part hit me hard. ""The Horde"" had me filled with rage more than anything else, I just wanted to shoot Abby right then and there, I was completely shaken and furious. But this? When I saw Joel's grave it all changed. I immediately started tearing up, fuck, I'm actually crying again while writing this. Seeing all the flowers and letters left on his doorstep? God.
When Ellie went to open the door, her hand trembling... I know that feeling all too well. Once inside I didn't rush anything, I wanted to take it all in, I interacted with every object, explored every room. Upstairs, when she found his watch and pistol I just whispered ""Aww :("", I saw the photo of Joel and young Ellie and immediately started tearing up again, and then the closet... she picked up one of Joel's jacket and smelled it. That was it, I completely lost it, everything I had been holding in burst out in that one moment.
After giving myself a bit of time I kept going, I was so mad at Tommy, of course he'd go after them, it's his damn brother, all that bs he told me before was just to keep me in Jackson.
Today was too much. I couldn't keep playing. I closed the game.
I know what you're thinking, ""Damn girl, how long is this post gonna be?"" don't worry, I'm not diving this deep into every chapter. I just felt like Chapter 1 deserved a bit of extra attention. To me it's by far the heaviest and most important part of the game, and it all happens before the story even really begins.
DAY 3/5 - Seattle Day 1
https://preview.redd.it/17jtzt7avg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2078ff377e3c77d8b762d4daf8c4c57720dd9be7
This part opens up like an open world, which was a cool surprise. We track someone from Abby's group to a TV station, but she's already dead. Ellie finds a photo of the people who killed Joel, now we got faces and names to go after, nice
https://preview.redd.it/6v3tk5edvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=61871117e468d6e3c4cf2474fcd87eff14a422e5
Then the tunnels happen, and it's pure chaos. Ellie's mask breaks, Dina panics, and for a second I thought we were losing her. We make it to the theater, and just as things start to settle Dina drops the bomb: ""I think I'm pregnant"" Ellie: ""What"" Me: ""WHAAAT?!"" Dina: ""Don't worry, it's not yours"", ""YEAH NO SHIT WHAT ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT!?!""
https://preview.redd.it/es6bzx1evg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ad691423ee5888d132e0e5005ce49a50fa5e50
Ellie's birthday flashback, wow. Easily one of the sweetest, most heartwarming moments in the entire game. I was completely floored, like, ""NO WAY, IT'S ACTUALLY A FREAKING DINOSAUR"" I started tearing up almost instantly. The whole sequence is just pure joy, it's beautiful, it's funny. Of course it made me miss Joel so much more, this was such an incredible surprise, I didn't expect something like this at all. It's really nice that they didn't just write Joel out of the story, but kept him alive through these memories. And the scene inside the capsule? Absolute perfection.
DAY 6/9 - Seattle Day 2
https://preview.redd.it/sfzd6n9fvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a244793a2bc83b3af0e5922a6463b4d8b697bdd
Hillcrest was intense, I really disliked being alone and the abundance of stalkers made it even more terrifying. Jesse's unexpected arrival was a huge relief, unfortunately it didn't last very long
https://preview.redd.it/kzasxqqgvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6c4d6822921d0db4522d41a01e1c6c2c7f651e9
The ""Finding Strings"" flashback, I just love these moments and always get overwhelmed with excitement, even though this one was a bit scary, I'll take any second I can get with Joel. Ultimately it did end on a somewhat funny / sweet moment.
Not much to say about the Seraphites, weird cult of fanatics, not a fan. As awful as everything with the Seraphites was in Day 2, it doesn't even come close to what goes down between Ellie and Nora.
https://preview.redd.it/ex3t95mjvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a8955914f8668a351cda4398aae9b737bdef6a7
This is where we really start to see Ellie lose herself, rage and revenge are eating her alive. The way she kills Nora is brutal, and when she returns to the theater... her hands are trembling, she's in shock. That bathroom scene right after wrecked me, I was holding back tears. There's something so raw about seeing someone in that state… and the shot of her back just adds to the weight of it all, covered in bruises and cuts... it hit hard.
I was waiting for the game to bring up the whole hospital thing, and they did. That flashback was rough, Ellie confirmed her suspicions, at first I didn't really get why she was so mad, Joel saved her. I eventually (sort of) understood her reasons later on.
DAY 10 - Seattle Day 3/The Park
https://preview.redd.it/2x67ewflvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b2ad93e472fd29d755ca476a0dd41d1f3ae4b1
Day 3 opens with a shot of Ellie’s back and the sight feels overwhelming as much as the other day, we get to spend some time with Jesse, he's a solid guy and I really liked his character, unfortunately once again we get to see how Ellie is slowly losing herself more and more, prioritising her revenge on Abby over everything else, the two split and Ellie goes once again on a solo mission to find Abby
https://preview.redd.it/aru7dgfqvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc035a8bb5f6e96eaeb684099188ea68cf2631d3
Infiltration (I know I said I wasn’t going to deep dive into other chapters but I feel like this one is important, sorry :>, future me, also the next one, sorry again, hey it's future me again, just a heads up it will happen a couple more times especially near the end, sorry not sorry I love yapping)
For the first time I really thought we were nearing the end of the game. I was convinced we'd find Abby at the aquarium, everything felt like it was leading up to that, the atmosphere, the heavy storm, Ellie struggling to keep it together. But nope, Abby's not there. Instead, Ellie ends up killing Mel and Owen, and when she realizes Mel was pregnant she just breaks down, completely overwhelmed. Tommy shows up with Jesse, I was so relieved to see Tommy, ""My god, finally"".
I never could've predicted what was coming next. Tommy and Jesse are planning the route back to Jackson, for a brief moment things feel calm, there's this light-hearted exchange between Jesse and Tommy, you catch yourself smiling and forgetting about Abby, forgetting all the darkness for just a second.
Then, a noise. My mind immediately went to Abby ""I bet it’s fucking Abby, she must've tracked us down"" Ellie and Jesse rush to check on Tommy, Jesse gets shot in the face. I let out this short but loud scream, like I was right there and saw it happen with my own eyes. It was sudden, brutal, completely out of nowhere.
And I was right. It's Abby. She's got a gun to Tommy's head, my heart's racing, I have no idea what's about to happen. ""Is she going to kill him too?"" Abby turns the gun on Ellie and the screen goes black.
At that point in the game, we still had no idea who Abby really was or why she wanted Joel dead. We knew nothing. So in that moment I was fully on Ellie's side, every kill felt justified, and my hatred for Abby was growing right alongside hers. I wanted her dead more than anything, from my notes: ""Listen, I don't give a fuck how bad this is going to be, there's nothing joel could have done to this bitch that would make me feel bad for her"".
Tracking Lesson
This chapter is absolutely essential. No one will ever convince me that anyone who played the game and reached this point didn't scream out loud or at least let out a gasp. I personally went with, hold on… let me check my notes… ah yes:
""Doc..? [about a 2 second pause] AAAEEEEUUUGGGH (that’s my interpretation of a loud gasp) HE’S THE DOC- THE DOCTOR, THE SURGEON, THE ONE THAT GOT KILLED BY JOEL, HOLY SHIT IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW"". 
We get to see the hospital scene from a totally different angle, and it turns out things weren't as black and white as they seemed. Marlene's decision wasn't as simple or heartless as I used to think back in Part I. I remember hating her, feeling completely betrayed and manipulated. In one of my previous posts I wrote something like: ""[…] Fuck you, Marlene. I get it, ""One over many"", screw that. They're all going to die one way or another, so who cares if humanity goes out? [...]"". That's easy to say when you've only seen one side of the story. Just for the record, if I had to make the choice again, I'd save Ellie every single time, even if it meant killing Abby's dad.
That said, did he deserve to die? Absolutely not, but it was a consequence of its own actions. Okay, but Abby not only didn't deserve to get her father killed, she also didn't do anything that would lead to the father's dead, so was her rage and actions against Joel justified? Joel made a choice driven by love, selfish, but deeply human. Abby was fueled by grief and needed someone to blame, Ellie wanted to make sense of a loss that shattered her. They're both stuck in this cycle of revenge, thinking it will bring them peace, but all it does is destroy more of who they are. They're both right in their own way, and both wrong in how they deal with it.  
DAY 11/13 - Seattle Day 1/2/3:
I'll try to keep these three chapters as brief as I can, with a bit more detail once I get to ""The Confrontation"".
At the time I really hated that the game was forcing us to play as Abby. It pissed me off because I knew exactly what they were trying to do, make us understand her, see things from her side, and eventually feel empathy for her. But I didn't want that, I was still full of anger, ""What, now I'm just supposed to play as the villain? As the one who killed Joel? No way"". All I wanted was to get back to the theater and see something like Dina coming up from behind and putting a bullet in Abby's head.
After hearing that Owen may have killed a WLF soldier to save a Seraphite, Abby sets out to find him. She gets captured by Seraphites and is saved by Yara and Lev. They battle through infected and WLF, forming a bond built on fragile trust. Abby eventually finds Owen at the aquarium, and after a tense and emotional night they reconnect intimately.
Abby goes back to Yara and Lev after that nightmare and finds Yara in critical condition, so she brings them to the aquarium and Mel agrees to do surgery if they can get supplies from the hospital. The Hotel part was already terrifying, but nothing compared to ""Ground Zero"". At the hospital Abby gets caught but Nora helps her sneak into the basement. I can't explain how fucking terrifying and stressful this section was, I kept putting it off, scrolling through Instagram, and it ultimately took me 2-3 hours. The Rat King? I was screaming, barely looking with one eye half open. Scariest moment in the series, hands down
https://preview.redd.it/s21ipm0tvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c7248ab78c31553c17c52e271c6409a11faf99f
By Day 3 I had come to understand and accept Abby, and I was genuinely enjoying playing as her. If I'm not mistaken she has three dreams in the Firefly hospital, and for the first time she wakes from a peaceful one of her father, it was really sweet. She was on the path to redemption, with Yara and Lev helping shape her into someone new. On the way to the marina, Abby joins Manny to deal with a sniper, I was shocked when it turned out to be Tommy, just moments before I was rooting for Abby and Manny to take that fucker down, and suddenly I didn't know how to feel. A perfect example of how easy it is to pick a side without the full picture. Tommy kills Manny, Abby nearly dies, and Yara saves her and they get to the Seraphite island to find Lev.
They push through during the WLF invasion and find Lev devastated after killing his mother in self-defense, It was such an intense scene, how could a mother treat her own child like that? The three attempt to flee but are caught by Isaac, when Abby refuses to surrender Lev, Yara sacrifices herself to save them. I went into this mission already expecting that one of them wouldn't make it, but I didn't think it would happen like that. I really feel for Yara, she was a true fighter.
Abby and Lev escape the island and get back to the aquarium, only to find Mel and Owen, dead. Abby is shattered. Here we find out exactly how Abby was able to track Ellie down, when Ellie left with Tommy and Jesse, she left her map on the ground, Lev found it and gave it to Abby. One small thing that got overlooked and changed everything.
What if Ellie hadn't left the map behind? I know it's kind of a pointless question, we could say the same about anything. Like, what if she looked left instead of right, saw a butterfly, followed it, and then missed a trap and died in an explosion, game over. Still, I do think that if she hadn't left the map, she and the others probably would've headed back to Jackson like they were planning to, and I doubt Abby would've risked following them there. Then again, who knows if Ellie would've actually gone back. It's just a never-ending loop of what ifs. Anyway, I'm rambling, sorry.
The Confrontation
The anticipation for this chapter was insane. I'd been playing for three days and couldn't stop thinking about what was waiting back at the theatre. I kept imagining hundreds of different outcomes, and every time I thought about it the scenario in my head got worse. As I walked in as Abby and started heading downstairs my heart was pounding, as I already knew Abby surprises Tommy from behind, Ellie and Jesse burst in, Jesse gets shot... and then? I had no idea. All those outcomes I had imagined? Completely vanished, suddenly my mind was blank, I didn't know what to expect anymore.
Tommy jumps on Abby, Lev shoots him in the leg, and Abby shoots him in the head, I'm fucking screaming. My first thought was, well, that's it for Tommy, actually, here's a quick entry from my notes:
""NOOOOO WAHT THE FUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKKKKK WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUCK, WHY AM I STILL PLAYING AS THIS FUCKING BITCH GIVE ME ELLIE, ELLIE DONT YOU DARE FUCKING DIE TOO""
As you can probably guess in that moment everything I had come to appreciate and understand about Abby just went straight out the window. While chasing Ellie all I wanted was to get shot, I didn't even try to shoot back once. It wasn't until I realized that if I wanted to finish the game I had to follow where the story was taking me, so I gave in and went along with it.
The first ""hide and seek"" part wasn't too hard, but every time a cutscene showed them fighting I was just SCREAMING, hoping Ellie would finally get the upper hand, only for her to get beaten down again and again. 
The floor collapses and the second phase of this whole ""hide and seek"" (I hate calling it hide and seek, is there a better name for this sequence?) thing begins, way harder this time. I honestly lost count of how many times I died. Ellie is insanely fast and her movements are so unpredictable, there's basically no way to hit her if you're even slightly in front of her, she can dodge bottles and because that wasn't enough she starts using traps and I'm seriously sweating, just trying to not get caught because I'd made it this far and didn't want to mess up and start all over again.
The moment Abby starts choking Ellie had me jumping up and down on my chair screaming, this time it was way too close. Ellie manages to pull out her knife and stab Abby in the leg, the gameplay keeps going. 
The whole time I'm thinking, what's it gonna be? Who's coming out on top? Is the game really making me kill Ellie?? Then another cutscene, Abby breaks Ellie's arm, that's it, there's no way Ellie's winning, she's just getting punched over and over and I'm yelling, and then ""OEEEAAEEHH (excited scream) DINAAAA, YEAAAAH CUT HER UP!"", Lev shoots Dina in the shoulder, ""FUUUUUUCK"", now I'm panicking for Dina, she's getting her head smashed, Abby pulls out her knife and I'm losing it, I thought for sure Dina was done for. It would've made sense, Ellie went after everyone Abby loved and now Abby's doing the same, right? 
""She's pregnant"", and Abby replies ""Good"". I'm screaming even louder, but thankfully Lev steps in, if it weren't for him Abby would've 100% slit Dina's throat. ""Don't ever let me see you again"".
I'm thinking this must be it, now that they're even there's nothing else worth going after. And the screen, once again, goes black.
""WEELL???""
Still Day 13 - The Farm
https://preview.redd.it/p5j3xmcuvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a1a11677d60160aa6b010191d2eeceb9a986d6c
Suddenly we're looking at this house in the middle of a beautiful landscape. ""ELLIE!?... Joel's watch :( … THE BABY!?!? Wait, how much time has passed? Dina was only a few weeks pregnant in Seattle, so… about 9 months for the pregnancy, and now the baby has a full head of hair and can sit up on his own… maybe 6 months old? So like, a year and 3 months? Damn… are we actually getting a happy ending??""
On the way to the tractor I saw the sheeps and realized this was literally Dina's dream, she talked about it back in Seattle, I think at the synagogue? Anyway, the whole thing felt unreal, after spending the last two weeks going through the most horrific things imaginable, suddenly there's this calm… it doesn't feel right, it feels like a dream. When Ellie goes to round up the sheep I peeped the inside of the barn and my first thought was, ""The barn looks way to scary, I swear if this is actually a dream that turns into a nightmare or something I’m uninstalling on the spot"" Reality was, this was much, much worse than a nightmare.
What follows is incredibly real, raw, and terrifying. As Ellie goes near the lamb one of the shovels falls and triggers a quick flash of Joel. She follows the lamb outside but a gust of wind slams the barn door shut leaving Ellie in total darkness, she immediately breaks down, slipping into a full on PTSD-triggered flashback, reliving what happened at the chalet. Dina rushes in, and we're met with this soul-crushing image of Ellie on the ground, sobbing, her face showing pure terror and the disorientation afterwards.
I just rewatched that scene to make sure I had everything in the right order because I tend to mix things up sometimes, and I couldn't help but cry again. These are the kinds of scenes that really hit me the hardest, I just can't handle watching someone in that much emotional and mental pain.
In the next scene Ellie comes back from hunting and there's a horse outside the house, I honestly didn't even notice it at first and I'm only mentioning it now after rewatching that part to help me write this and I just realized that I completely missed it, most likely because I was still processing everything that had just happened moments before. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting anyone to be inside the house, let alone Tommy. I doubt anyone was, I mean, unless I missed some clues somewhere, the guy got shot in the fucking head. So yeah, seeing him alive was a total surprise, and a good one at first, I was really happy to see him again.
But that feeling didn't last long. As soon as he said, ""I got something to show you"" something felt off, and then he pulled out that damn map, I just sat there in disbelief while he talked about Abby and everything else, and now I'm […]
Sorry, future me here, I just realized how many times in this post I've said that I felt exactly like Ellie, at the exact same moments she did. And I can't help but think that's probably a deliberate effect of the brilliant writing behind this story. It's like every time you're feeling something, the character is too, and they manage to pull that off every single time. It's honestly crazy.
Anyway, […] going from confused to straight-up angry, like, what the fuck is wrong with him? Why would he bring this up again? Did the bullet mess with his brain or something? Those were the thoughts running through my head. But then I looked at Ellie's face and my anger started shifting into fear. She's thinking about it, of course she is. She never stopped, how could she?
Tommy's last two comments before leaving were completely uncalled for, but I get where they're coming from (not that it makes them okay). His leg is fucked, he's lost an eye, he can't go after Abby himself anymore, that promise Ellie made? He held onto that, for months. Tommy's no different from Ellie, or even Abby for that matter (well, Abby was actually able to move on by now but you get what I’m trying to say), they're all carrying unimaginable loss, all trying to cope in whatever way they can, even if it's the wrong way and in the end they're all chasing the same thing: peace.
Next up we get a shot of Dina and JJ in bed. As the camera slowly pulls back, it becomes clear that someone is missing… and there's this sound of wind, like a door or window was left open. I both hate and love how they mess with us in scenes like this. Of course, my first thought was, ""No she fucking didn't"" (as in, Ellie already left). But no, she's still here, just sitting silently on the bed.
This entire sequence, just like the start of the chapter feels unreal, like a dream, actually a nightmare this time, I totally expected an infected to just grab me through a window and then she'd suddenly wake up in a panic, all sweaty or something.
I realized I could go into Ellie's room, but before triggering anything I wanted to walk around the house. She stumbles on her guitar, her playing always hits me emotionally, every single time. Then I finally went upstairs and into her room, she pulls out her journal from the box. We get a look at the most recent entries and find out she's been having those flashbacks again and again…
""When will this stop?"",
""I don't want to talk about it. It's just gonna hurt."",
""I feel so guilty."",
""My skin hurts."",
""Can I leave it all behind?"".
Suddenly we're back in Jackson. At first I wasn't sure if this was future or past Ellie but then I noticed her longer hair, and once they showed her face, it was clear this was past Ellie. Then Jesse appears on screen, which was such a pleasant surprise, I really, really liked him as a character and honestly feel like he didn't get enough screen time.
Ellie says something I can't quite remember word for word, but it was along the lines of ""You'll get back together in two weeks"" referring to Jesse and Dina, and that's when it finally clicked, this was the night Dina kisses Ellie. I was so excited, it was a really awkward, funny, sweet moment… until that old dickhead showed up. I genuinely felt bad for Joel in that moment and the whole situation instantly turned painfully uncomfortable.
We're back at the farm, and we see Ellie packing... I already know what this means, and I'm begging to be wrong, begging for her to stay. Dina knows it too, it's obvious.
""I have to finish it"", the look on Dina's face says it all. It's the same expression I had, I was hoping Ellie wouldn't say something like that.
""You don't owe Tommy anything.""
""It's not about Tommy...""
""I don't sleep. I don't eat. I'm... I'm not like you, Dina."", probably referring to how Dina (at least to her eyes), managed to move on, or at least cope, with everything, including Jesse. Ellie even touches on that in her journal...
""Stay.""
""I can't.""
""We've got a family. She doesn't get to be more important than that.""
Unfortunately Ellie hasn't come to that realization yet, and I can't blame her. After everything she's been through, how could she possibly think clearly? She's not driven by logic at this point, she's driven by pain, by loss, by everything she's had to carry since that day in the chalet. It's not even about revenge anymore, she just wants the pain to stop, and the only way she sees that happening is by getting Abby out of her head, once and for all. And to her the only way to do that is to finish what she started. What other option does she see? There's no peace, no closure, not until she tries. Even if it costs her everything. At least that's how I see it.
Now I'm completely thrown off. When this chapter started, I genuinely thought that was it, Ellie and Dina, finally getting to live the quiet life they deserve. But suddenly we're back on Abby's trail and I'm just thinking, seriously? How much longer is this going to drag on? It feels like the third time this cycle starts over and each time I'm convinced it's going to end with Ellie dead.
Today was really something. The chapter was short but really intense, I couldn't bring myself to keep going, I just saved the game and closed it. I spent the rest of the day lying in bed. Call it pathetic if you want, I don't care. When you spend nearly a month @ (between Part I and Part II), living in this world, walking in the shoes of this one character, it gets to you. You see this character grow, go through moments of light and darkness (mostly darkness), and it becomes impossible not to get attached, to the point where they're all you can think about.
@ Yes, almost a full month. I'm slow, my first playthrough took around 17 or 18 hours and almost a week to finish because it was my first time playing a horror game and I couldn't handle more than an hour or two a day, plus, I have this bad habit of gaming only at night, which didn't help. And as you can see, Part II is taking me twice as long.
Day 14/15 - Santa Barbara/The Farm Epilogue
https://preview.redd.it/jl6jcncwvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=822714045c4beceaa830fa0970689de31b33db2e
Unrelated to the chapter, but I just ran this whole post through a character count tool and I'm already over 32k which is kind of insane, I've got just under 8k characters left before hitting Reddit's 40k limit, and honestly I have no idea how I can expect anyone to read all of this. If you made it this far, you're an absolute legend, I seriously appreciate you and I hope you found the post at least a little entertaining, or that some of my thoughts gave you something interesting to think about. Fun fact: I nominated Ellie exactly 69 times. Anyway, back to the chapter.
Santa Barbara
[Had to erase this part because I exceeded the Reddit character limit and I honestly don't know what else to delete, you can find it in the comments]
One of the Rattlers nearly gets bit by the clicker, blah blah blah, you know what happens, I'm running out of characters (quite embarrassing actually, can you believe that this post is almost as long as Reddit allows?) and want to get to the point already. When we reach the beach I was stuck for a bit, I didn't know what to do, then I heard coughing and looked up and  realized I could interact with someone tied to the cross and, holy shit it's Abby. She's completely unrecognizable, she looks absolutely wrecked, malnourished, her hair is different.I interact with her and she just says, ""It's you."" I can't even imagine what's going through her mind, probably thought she was about to get stabbed.
But Ellie cuts her down, Abby helps Lev down, then looks back at Ellie, and kind of invites her along, saying there are boats. So now I'm sitting there thinking, ""WELL??? SO WHAT NOW WE JUST GO HOME?""
They each go to their boats, and… Ellie sees Joel again and remembers what made her come here in the first place. She grabs Abby and throws her into the water, Abby doesn't want to fight but Ellie pulls her knife on Lev and I completely lose it. I'm yelling at the screen (as usual), begging her not to go through with it, Abby agrees to fight and it's brutal. By this point I had come to terms with my anger toward Abby that was reignited during the theatre part. I genuinely wanted both of them to live, but more than anything I wanted Ellie to get what she came for so yeah I guess in a way I also indirectly wanted Abby dead
https://preview.redd.it/gfjnhn7yvg1f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=83a20cf1bbc56653f2f5a4279c9ebc85f3d9ea2e
As Ellie's drowning Abby, she gets another flashback of Joel, fuck I'm tearing up again, Jesus, sorry. This time it's different, he's sitting on the patio, playing his guitar. Smiling. Peaceful. Ellie lets Abby go.
The Farm Epilogue
We're back at the farm and the house already looks abandoned from the outside, then it hit me, Ellie killed that fat Rattler who said Abby had been taken months ago. I don't know exactly how much time passed between Tommy tracking her and Abby being captured but it couldn't have been too long, factor in the trip to Santa Barbara, which is what, two or three states away? All by foot? And then back, it had to be at least a couple of months. Dina must have been alone all that time, she clearly knew where Ellie was going and must've had an idea of how long it might take, but I doubt she stayed much longer after Ellie left. At that point it wasn't about holding onto hope that she'd come back, Ellie had made her choice, and Dina understandably didn't take it well.
So yeah, I wasn't surprised to find the house empty, and neither was Ellie by the looks of it. I checked every room just in case Dina had left a note or something, but I wasn't really expecting to find anything. Ellie's room was almost untouched.
Ellie picks up her guitar one more time. Until that moment it hadn't even crossed my mind that she’s wouldn't be able to play anymore because she had lost two fingers on her fretting hand. Ellie strums a few broken notes, looking completely devastated.
Then we're back with Joel, on the patio, that same flashback she had during the fight with Abby. I was crying like hell, both when I played it and now writing this. The conversation goes from ""coffee, nice"" to ""I should've died in that hospital"" in an instant. I mentioned earlier in this post that I didn't really understand why she would think that. But I think I do now, she believed that was her purpose, even if she didn't know she was going to die at the time, she knows now, and still, she feels like that should have been her fate. Maybe because that idea that her life only had meaning if it was sacrificed, was planted in her from a very young age. It's easy to instill certain beliefs in children, and if those thoughts aren't addressed, especially something that significant, they can carry them into adulthood and continue to believe them. Back at the farm, the ending couldn't be more heartbreaking, Ellie sets the guitar down and walks away, the screen turns back one final time.
Conclusions
There's a lot I would like to talk about but I've actually got a couple hundreds of characters left so I'll just get this one point across: Everyone calling Ellie a cold-blooded murderer is wrong. ""But she killed hundreds of WLF, Seraphites, blah blah blah"" No. You did that, not Ellie. That's the gameplay part, realistically she would've gone through most of it without killing anyone, and the people she does kill are those who leave her no choice. The only exception is Nora, but even then it's not like Ellie walks away unaffected, she was shaking and was left visibly traumatized by what she did. She's not a monster, she's a 19 year old girl who lost everything, including herself.
Jesus It's 4AM and I just finished proof-reading everything, this post took me about 3 days to write and I really hope that someone reads at least half of it but I don't expect anyone to. Anyway.
Thank you for reading :)
TL;DR; Cried a lot, then cried some more.",0.6037412285804749
comments discussing story of the game,"Another wonderful and thoughtful read from you, I’m so glad! I have to say at first that I too put the game away at some point, probably around the parts you did. It was crushingly dark and heavy, the mood was really getting to me. Now I’ve been replaying the game and am actually in the middle of another break. 😅 Gets to you, doesn’t it, these games we play?
Anyway! At the end of every play through I arrive at the same conclusion - that the story was worth the pain and darkness, I wouldn’t change a thing about it story-wise. And don’t get me wrong, I certainly hoped for something “better” for Ellie, the ending is devastating, but I also think the game earned the right to be that way. How do you feel having now finished the game? Again, thanks for this post, I’ll sure be coming back to it. 😊",0.6176508069038391

comments discussing story of the game,"Probably a hot take here, but... I don't really agree with the notion that a television show simply can't convey the story of Part II as well as the video game can. To be sure, to your point about how we're with the protagonist of a video game every second (which, worth noting, game writers largely ""show you"" a character's mental state through characters talking to themselves; that's largely how they do that in the medium. They're audio ""thought bubbles"" that, while sometimes used with success in television [see: Scrubs], is largely not something television audiences really enjoy). Or they pair up with a computer-controlled partner so that the protagonist can just keep talking and share those inside thoughts with (but is ultimately about communicating to the player).
In a show or movie, you have to show it through other means. This does usually include dialogue between characters too, to be sure, but also through other means. Like in the show, we could have a moment where Ellie goes ham on killing an infected and Dina needs to really yank her ""back to reality"" because she's lost control. We could have more moments that hint at friction between Dina and Ellie to show that while Ellie is able to take some pleasure right now in the good thing happening to her with this relationship, her descent is occurring and the seeds that strain could be planted. We could have had them find those Seraphite bodies, then find some WLF soldiers where Ellie winds up killing them in a way surprising even to herself because she was affected by the carnage she saw them bring and was subconsciously recalling the carnage on Joel. We could even just have a shot of Ellie writing a thought in her journal while Dina sleeps where we can see some text written to indicate she's getting darker.
We don't need to have Ellie ripping out throats from combat animations and increasingly disturbing comments in those moments. There's stuff the game does that is unique to games, but the core story here is not one that can only be conveyed through that medium. I think this show is fine. Not great. Not terrible. Great in some ways and making some changes I like (I like Ellie seeming younger, I feel like I always forget she's not 30 in these games, even if I wish they'd been working in the darkness more than they have, and I know I'm in the minority, but I so far love the changes they've made with Tommy). Mid-tier HBO show to me as a television fan. I think they're mostly doing ok getting the gist of things. But I don't think this is the best version of a television adaptation we could be getting. I'd honestly trade some of the production value of the sets and make-up (which are pretty incredible) for a more developed season.",0.6001549959182739
comments discussing story of the game,"Although I really missed the banter between Bill and Ellie from the game, I was amazed at how they created that entire backstory for Frank and Bill just from the letter they found with his body in the game.

comments discussing story of the game,"The game story wouldn’t have worked in the show here because so much of what made that work is the medium of gameplay
Really the comedic undertone of Bill/Frank as portrayed in the game would have come off as really tone-deaf and out-of-place for a show like this, and for the fact that it's 2023 and most viewers are not impressed by ""we included a gay couple, there, are you satisfied?"" anymore and need more to make it more than a tired novelty but an actual story.
Honestly I wouldn't expect less of the creator of Chernobyl. If he adapted the game's storyline as direct as some of the other scenes that do work as-is, it wouldn't have felt right for the series. He's also sending a message that every part of this story is going to effect you, that this is a real world and nobody gets out being comedy relief or dismissible as just devices to drive the story somewhere.",0.6086106896400452

comments discussing story of the game,"On that same note, I find it hilarious how people can even complain that the show doesn’t strictly follow the game, when the creator and writer of the game is literally co-running the show and was pitching a movie version of the game for years himself before it finally ended up on HBO instead. It’s his story. If he agrees with Mazin that this is what a TV show version of the story needed, then who are we to complain? Especially when it’s this fucking good!
This debate will always happen. The first time I realized that was with Jackson’s LotR films and the things they cut or changed in those. It was also when I learned that people who are obsessive fans of a story in one particular medium, will be insufferable if that story ever gets adapted to another medium. The books don’t stop being good because the films changed some things and were also good, nor will this show ruin the game, even if it deviates from the exact way it told the story.",0.6015477180480957

comments discussing story of the game,"Long comment and late reply, but the idea I was trying to get across is that Joel was acting from understandable human instinct. The fireflies ARE acting like tuskegee experimenters and other medical research atrocities — the doctors were acting from desperation to prevent horrific disease.  
It is the writers creating these moral questions, Joel is only a character. The writers chastised his choice publicly using the torture / bomb logic. They create a sort of facsimile of moral ambiguity; they treat Joel as in the wrong and an instigator of blood feud. They equalize the fireflies. It doesn’t matter that Ellie semi consented — women today have a baby in the hospital and consent to that treatment then get surprise gyno exams while knocked out. Consent is either informed or not actually consent at all. Ellie kills hundreds, gets to Abby, stops. Another boring gaming trope.
I just find the writing frustrating. The characters are charismatic, but the central thesis of the plot fails. I think it could be improved substantially if the writers were willing to engage with historical context & philosophy in a more deep way than scanning wikipedia and reading reddit threads.

Complaining that someone expressed their dissatisfaction with a game in detail to defend their OPINION is certainly A viewpoint, but i hardly see it as a strike against them.

If you dislike this game, it’s simply because you just don’t get what story this game was trying to tell. It can’t possibly be that you had legitimate criticisms or simply didn’t vibe with it. You need to write an entire dissertation on why exactly it didn’t work for you, and even then it’ll be dismissed as being wrong.
And God forbid you even mention the word revenge, because don’t you know it’s not a “revenge is bad” type of game? It’s actually about how *insert convoluted way of explaining how revenge is bad without using the word.” And yes, I know it’s not just about that. I’ve heard it all.
People on Reddit are so pretentious about this game and what it has to say.
And on a personal note, Druckmann’s own history and statements about Israel makes it very hard not to side eye the whole “both factions are bad, but hey one side are psychopathic religious homophobic fanatics out to murder a trans kid, and the other side are real human beings driven to do bad things, but I’m still gonna show you half a dozen of them to humanize them.” Even their dog is more humanized than any Serapahite.",0.6476274132728577

You have to excuse us for saying that when people still fundamentally fail to grasp the most basic concepts of this game.

comments discussing story of the game,"I mean your point is the same as saying “Lord of the Rings story is good guys better than evil guys!”. Or saying Lord of the Files theme is “humans are evil”. What you said is you didn’t like how mercy and kindness are shown to be weaknesses while the game is saying “revenge bad being nice good!”. My point is that’s a very simplistic way of looking at the story. The story doesn’t have some point. It’s not trying to teach you some message. It wants to tell an interesting story between two characters consumed by vengeance. It draws parallels between them and wants you to think about how you view both. What you want to take away from the game is up you. But it’s not bad writing that the game isn’t a string of events that all point to one simple message. Sometimes revenge works out sometimes kindness works out and sometimes they result in terrible situations but ultimately it’s the violence and the grief and the trauma that drive the characters. Do you get what I’m saying. It’s not that “revenge is bad and not worth it”. It’s “Ellie's and Abby's quests for vengeance against each other ultimately demonstrate that while the instinct for violence can be all consuming, the path to a meaningful future lies in finding forgiveness and letting go of hatred”. It’s the same as LoTR isn’t “being good always wins!” Its “ordinary people are capable of great courage and heroism, and that the true way to defeat the inherit evil of humanity is through kindness and sacrifice not domination”. Sure you can summarize the second thesis into the first but it doesn’t mean they’re the same. Why is revenge bad? Why do good guys always win? That’s what these stories are about",0.6114592552185059
comments discussing story of the game,"Then that’s on them? I’m one of the seemingly few people that played the second game without seeing any of the leaks, I avoided any TLOU content after the announcement trailer dropped in 2017.
So I had a very unbiased look going into it. I was absolutely devastated over what happened to Joel. Like stopped the game and cried for two hours devastated, I cried harder than I did when my grandma died.
I didn’t have Joel on this pedestal that a good chunk of the fans did and still do, we know he’s done some awful things, the “I’ve been on both sides” line after the ambush by the faction in Pittsburgh, and Tommy saying “I have nothing but nightmares from those years”
And you know what’s hilarious? Abby has the same story that Joel had. Jaded by a great loss of a family member driven to do some horrible shit where they eventually meet a kid that changes their view about things, going on to be a better person.
I understand disliking Abby as a character, but her story is the same as Joel’s, so I’m kinda of the opinion that you can’t dislike Abby’s story while praising Joel’s, in fact I would go as far to say a lot of the hate towards her is rooted in misogyny.",0.6003597974777222

Games confronting uncomfortable or ambiguous stuff is really nothing new but people can be really sensitive when that stuff feels like it is lacking depth and is only done for shock value. Basically, they can tell apart games where the suffering is making a point vs those where suffering is the point.
Unfortunately for me, Part 2 falls into the later camp. You can just really see the strings where the game just constantly pulls and directs the story towards misery rather than it being a natural tragedy. Just feels really artificial as a result.",0.6022698283195496

comments discussing story of the game,"Thanks for that, I haven’t played since i finished it when it released so seeing you comment was nice to open the convo back up hah. I appreciate it cuz honestly this brought some nice clarity to ideas I have always struggled with.
I never thought about it but I agree choosing marlene over the surgeon to derive the character of Abby’s background would’ve at least made me relate more as well. But again, your point about Joel ascending back to humanity just makes anyone who wanted to side with the surgeon less relatable. And Especially their random daughter. Like the whole point of the final decision in the first one was so incredible, it doesn’t make sense to punish him, (and destroy all that character development) as the basis for the next plot.
I wish they didn’t go for the mustache twirling villainous plot line. They could’ve just road horses, and talked about giraffes for 20 hours of gameplay as long as it was Elly and Joel growing with the same great commentary. Lol.
In a sea of pretty meh zombie storylines, you get TLOU and see the potential of amazing storytelling, only to be let a bit down with the sequel. It is the best still.

The second one is a story that has something to say. It challenges the player, in a way that is too challenging for some people, but as an ""I play games for the stories"" person like you, I absolutely loved it. It's NOT a retelling of a tale as old as time, but one that makes you think and examine your own thoughts, feelings, and biases. And it's a story that takes advantage of gaming as a medium to tell its story in a way that I don't think I'd ever seen before.

comments discussing story of the game,"Maybe you're right! But not posting unmarked spoilers is a very clear (and obviously enforced) subreddit rule, as the very nature of patient gaming means that people will be discovering older games all the time. We want to be a place where people can discuss those games freely and not feel like every older game will be spoiled for them just by virtue of being here.
In this particular case, OP made a post reviewing a game and was very conscientious about not spoiling anything in the post body, just as any professional game review outlet would do. If a user was on the fence about the game and wanted to check out a spoiler-free review here to decide whether to play it, OP's post provided that. Most commenters on the post clocked this fact (I love you all) and made sure to similarly avoid any spoilers in their comments. Some did not. Is this an inherent risk of participating on a public forum? Sure! Should we blame a spoiled user for being spoiled in what is clearly demarcated as a spoiler-free zone? I think that's where you lose me.
People need to make their own decisions about what level of spoiler risk they're willing to undertake in order to join discussions like this one, but our community is explicitly spoiler-free by default, and we owe it to our fellow members to ensure that all spoilers are clearly marked so that it can stay that way.",0.6617932915687561

There's so much to take in, so people (like my older brother) prefer playing Animal Crossing, Apex Legends, or other games with friends. Having a narrative that makes you invested in characters and possibly depressed or crying by the end of it may not help as much with mental fortitude.

No one actually care about garbage youtubers and their clicks. People are using that as a shield to further attack the game.
All signs are pointing to this game selling like crazy. There are already people who track sales saying this and it is selling out preorders.

What amazed me most was that every single element of the game aligned with the core vision and theme. The actors were incredible and the choice to tell the story out of order with the flashbacks and cycles of time in Seattle was done so well.

So happy to see this exact line in your review, OP.

The number of arguments I've read that say, ""the game hits you over the head saying revenge is bad but then I have to kill a bunch of people?!"" or ""the game tries to make me feel bad for killing when it's not even my choice?!"" is pretty maddening.

I have little to nothing to add here, since I agreed with everything you pointed out. I just never paid the prologue this much attention, but you were spot on.
I remember going into the game and feeling I did not know where I was. All of these characters I spent so many ours with, getting used to their voices and the way they think...none of that was there. Oddly enough, only Maria felt like herself. At the time, I could not put my finger on it, but I surely could tell I did not feel good. Going back in the way Part II did felt unpleasant, like changing cities and then coming back to see that all my friends changed their personalities and made new friends. I don't know. It did not feel welcoming as it should.

comments discussing story of the game,"In the words of a certain ""video game donkey"" ""The relationship between Joel and Ellie is what defined the first game.. just as its absence defines the second""
just because you didn't like how the certain character developments played out doesn't make it a bad game. Or Dr.uckmann a bad writer.
Take how YOU feel about the happenings of the game out of the equation. And you have an incredibly tightly knit story. Written, acted, animated, and directed (gameplay and cinematics wise) To near perfection..
(That whole thing with Mel taking her nearly born baby into active combat and the insertion of politics with the ""why would it be owens choice"" kinda tilted me. I'd say that's the one contrivance that kind of pulled me out.) But even at that you can kinda just be like. ""Okay so she's just an a-hole"" and leave it at that

While gameplay is subjective, I found OP's attempts at calling the gameplay of especially TLOU2 uninnovative and the likes. I personally found the fluidity of TLOU2's gameplay and grittiness of it to be exceptionally brutal and ""enjoyable""(I felt uncomfortable at times, especially in certain significant fights, but it was enjoyable in the manner that I could not put the controller down). What I found incredibly genius about it that only caught on in later playthroughs is just how much the gameplay is tied into the story. The story and the gameplay evolve together.

comments discussing story of the game,"Very insightful and attentive notes.
In a show, I love action and good writing/storytelling and Pedro pascal (obviously lol). I only played the first half of this game a long time ago but was also only recently told to watch this/reminded it exists - and I love it.
As I think you mentioned before, most game adaptations to shows suck. I was pleasantly surprised, to put it mildly, with how seriously this story was taken when it came to the show. The infected are actually kinda scary, and I've been on edge for more jump scares than actually occur. Not a love for me, but I'd imagine that was the goal of the producers to some extent, so props to them. It makes you think and anticipate within and beyond each moment represented, and I appreciate that very much. Good on them.
Anyway. I'm drunk and it's late. You're a pretty good writer, op, if you cared to edit. Don't judge cause I refuse to either especially right now. Trying to give a compliment.
Good show. That sounds like an understatement, because it's great. Can't wait for season 2.",0.6578000783920288

Particularly enjoyed how you worded out the meaning behind the ending, the flashbacks merely seen as emotional anchors not to lose the player and Listen Mode... oddly enough, I apply the same critique to the gameplay: imho TLoU's original gameplay felt more natural and grounded and so more fitting to the world and suitable to my liking, even though it's simpler and average.

comments discussing story of the game,"No, thank you!
Indeed it helps, but it still takes a lot of dedication to go over it in such a structured way!

comments discussing story of the game,"They like to make out that is some kind of conspiracy. I'm pretty sure it isn't but maybe it should be until we get to a point whereby when a game focuses on a narrative from a perspective of the female or gay characters people aren't angrily bashing the phrase 'go woke, go broke' or 'SJWs' frantically into the comment sections of the internet.
How is it possible that you people understand so little and still try to make an argument out of it? IT DOES NOT FUCKING MATTER WHO THE PROTAGONIST OF A STORY IS. What does matter is whether beloved characters are redefined or pushed out of existing franchises to make room for the next agenda to push. What also matters is when race, gender or sexual orientation become the definiting attribute of what characters are.
Cuckmann is the definition of being an idiotic SJW who takes over a franchise and destroy it in the name of his agenda.",0.6116764545440674
comments discussing story of the game,"And you my narrow minded friend have proved my point by suggesting that it's all some conspiracy. Joel being pushed to one side is a fair point but you and other keyboard warriors make it about race or sexual orientation or gender.
Learn to read.
Also interesting that I am narrow-minded, considering that there are quite a number of diverse games among those I enjoyed the most. Like Gone Home, Life is Strange, the TWD series. Hellblade and Horizon and probably more than I can remember. You can even find JJ Macfield there, a game where you play a trans character.
Enjoying those games or being open minded like you call it does not mean I need to accept a sub-par story because devs felt the need to pander to the SJW cloud. Give me diverse, good characters and we are fine. Give me idiotic characters like Abby in your agenda to create the perfect, non-sexualized character and twist the story to make her and her brain-dead sidekick sympathetic then the game can fuck off.
No one ever says 'why is this dude banging all these chicks? I know he's straight but do they have to make it so obvious' and remember when people got all pissy when Battlefield had playable female characters.
And Battlefield was hurt by that pandering. Also, what is this nonsense about ""that dude""?
If you recall I made the point that it was a vocal minority. If you got triggered by what I said then and are somone who gets annoyed by either black or gay or females in videogames then a game with the complexity of TLOU or TLOU2 isn't for you.
And here we have it, the classical troll reply when no argument is left: 'you haters did not understand it'. God, so pathetic.
May I suggest Angry Birds or something in keeping with your level of maturity.
Somebody who's arguments got dismantled everywhere in this whole thread should really not judge the capability of others. Because seeing your understanding of there story, between the two of us I am not the one better suited for Angry Birds.",0.6036017537117004
comments discussing story of the game,"""Also from what is suggested about Jackson they seem to take on new recruits and members to their community. We also know they would take in visitors as Joel explains that he traded some of his belongings for coffee at the end of the game""
Stuff like this is basically the whole reason why theres just ""game of this generation"" and ""the worst trash of this generation"" people. Like you can completely take every little piece and many times use your imagination/interpretation to say ""no no, this is because this and that"" and say that those who dont do that are just to dumb, ignorant or even just resent the game because theyre bigots/homophobes. Or you can just see what actually happened on screen, like what actually was and is and judge it by that.
Id say though that the necessity to piece stuff together or even interpret and imagine things to a story or game is a bad thing. For example, I recently red a comment on the Morpheus vs Neo fight scene in the Matrix, which said that the sparring program was designed so that Morpheus wins, so Neo landing a hit was already the sign that he is the chosen one. Because he broke the rules of the world he was in.
Now the thing is, this is just interpretation, which imo makes the scene even better, but, it is not necessary, the scene just worked perfectly. But if something is in question, and you need to interprete and piece stuff together to make it work flawlessly, its flawed.",0.6481518149375916
comments discussing story of the game,"I wasnt saying you do, this was just to sum up how this whole situation in the fanbase came upon based of your post.
And this isnt about spelling everything out, its about what a character did contradicts to much to what he wouldve done in the original material, and in order to oppose the criticism that comes from that contradiction people use words like ""it seems that"" and bits and pieces of information and make it work. The Neo/Morpheus scene didnt need that interpretation because it wasnt in question, the interpretation just added to something that already worked, the ""it seems Jackson is looking for recruits"" interpretation is needed in order to make it work.
And beyond that if information is too far away or disconnected from what is happening a piece of entertainment becomes more of a piece of work because the audience has to reach so far to add it into the event that is happening. Its like people become detectives to make sense of what happened or is happening.
Tbh I dont think that if someone is truly honest about this game it cant be defended as being good overall. All these interpretations arent what the game is, but again, theyre needed to make it work, so it doesnt work in the end.",0.6060364842414856
comments discussing story of the game,You make some good points but I only made this post to highlight how some things need defending because of what I perceive as being nitpicky. For example Joel supposedly acting out of character. I don't agree with this but can see how it is a valid criticism. Similarly with the dislike of Abby. However what I do find some reasons for disliking the game as needlessly critical. When people are adamant that the vaccine wouldn't have worked because 'vaccines don't work on infections' this is both scientifically inaccurate (I've seen a number of medical publications state research is being undertaken to see if vaccines could work against fungal infections to combat antibiotic resistance) and also overallyy critical. Also I feel the whole Ellie had time to shhot debate is also overally critical. All stories and narratives require some suspension of disbelief. I'm sure you could bring up any story or movie or whatever and no matter how well received it is and you could poke holes in some part of its logic,0.6294766664505005

comments discussing story of the game,"Pretty much my experience. Like, I could've written that myself including the Hillcrest part.
Pacing of the game is part of why people were ""depleted"" at the end but that has been discussed before so I just tried to stay on my specific point. I think the fact that the game is beautiful, and the cinematic gameplay is attractive makes some people not pay attention to the story itself. We have to be objective, we all don't have the same ""priorities"", for me storytelling in this game is my number 1 priority, graphics and gameplay come in a clear second place. Butchering the story and characters that I care about can't be compensated with nicer graphics and gameplay. What NC tried to push as a ""revolutionizing"" story h driven games and pushing boundaries was nothing but an amateurish push for moral lectures. I remember a verse from an old song that goes something like ""if someone steals but then sacrifices himself (like in, sacrifices his life to save others), what should we do?"" And I can hear NC in the back, ""stealing is wrong!""
NC tried to ""push"" way too many boundaries, from both technical and moral points of view and the result was a beautiful but chaotic mess. If he had picked one maybe, just maybe, it would've been a different story (pun intended!)

comments discussing story of the game,"Thank you. You wrote your post beautifully and it was a pleasure to read your perspective.
I have mostly the same observations but i appreciated the story nevertheless.
So i just gonna give my perspective on how I see this.
Ellie becoming a horrifying wreck of a person unable to move on until the very end was a story that resonated very deeply with me. She did horrible acts (just like Joel did), but she manager to turn away at yet another last moment and save the last bits of humanity she had in herself.
Yes the story could have finished in Jackson on a tractor with potato but then it would have not been this story.
I liked the game because it was bleak, horribly violent and didn’t really hold back. So for me that’s why it is a masterpiece.",0.6437488198280334

Your post pretty much sums up what I felt while playing as well. Initially I was frustrated that I'm restarting the whole game as Abby but then grew to like it pretty quickly.
But again Part 1 is one of my all time favourites and I think they failed to live up to that. Maybe because Part 1 was a complete story and Part 2 they had to slightly force a narrative into it.
In Part 2, I also felt that even tho they tried to elevate this story from just a revenge tale to something more layered, Part 1 still feels more deep and much more layered. Idk if that makes sense.",0.6034017205238342

If you didn’t like the gameplay itself that’s fine. But I think it’s silly to say you expected a better story when you just wanted a story that ties up neatly, when TLOUP2 is intentionally messy and supposed to leave you feeling dissatisfied.
Like that’s the whole point of the game, as a work of art. You’re supposed to feel uncomfortable. You’re supposed to grapple with the fact that you no longer like or relate to a character you loved.

Ellie completely lost herself and I think it’s to the game’s credit that she lost me too.

I personally like to feel uncomfortable sometimes with stories. Kind of like watching a horror movie. I of course hated seeing Joel be killed gruesomely. I hated feeling like Ellie was turning into the bad guy very quickly. But those things made me feel something deeply in a way not many games do. I get the sense, not necessarily from you, but from other people that hated the game, that they don’t like to feel sad or mad about something that happens in a story. (Pertaining specifically to critiques of story, not gameplay)
I really liked how they made two factions (Ellie and Dina vs. WLF and Abby’s friends) that were harder than usual to decide how I felt about who was more moral, without it just being two factions that suck (Skyrim’s empire and storm cloaks).

I really, really, really love how the show took the opportunity to “fix it” where the game followed the trope. Despite the tragic backdrop of a post-apocalyptic setting, these gay men found love and got a happily ever after. They got to grow old together, which is rare to see for queer characters.

In my opinion it’s neither. Technically the game is top notch. Obviously the graphics are fantastic. The gameplay builds on what Part 1 did well and makes it better. It’s really well acted and the moment to moment writing is pretty good.
But the game suffers from its pacing. Cutting to a ~10 hour playable flashback in the middle of what seemed to be the climax of the game is a really bold choice. I understand what they were trying to do and I appreciate that they were willing to take risks, but it just throws everything off. (And it’s something I was really hoping the show would attempt to fix.) Then we return to climax and it’s not even the end of game.

Going from day 3 back to day 1 was a big turnoff. I feel if they switched characters throughout the whole game, it would've been more engaging and impactful. You also would've cared a lot more about killing Owen and the dog as Ellie. Would've been so shocking.
I also agree with the general sentiment that, Tommy and Joel introducing themselves like that was stupid and out of character. Also Ellie went idiotic on the last leg. I didn't buy her doing all that. But it's fiction, they can do whatever they want.
I get that it may not be for everyone, cause it is quite miserable. A friend of mine had to stop playing cause it was too much for her.

It has many exposition cutscenes yes, but also has so much story packed in the background. There’s Ellie’s notebook, the environmental storytelling with old posters/signs and even just general body language that is said without uttering a single line of dialogue.
A lot of the story is told between the lines and plays out a lot like a book.

comments discussing story of the game,"That's the most reasonable case. For example, most of the time, the complaint that comes up in the very beginning of the game is how joel doesn't say the appropriate things right before he dies. That statement underestimates video games a lot, especially ones crafted like this one. Neil explained in a podcast with Troy Baker, how he finds it interesting/weird that so many people make that complaint when he thinks the facial expressions, camera work, delivery of lines and overall feeling of tension make it pretty obvious that joel is aware of something. Throwing useless exposition at a moment like this just isn't something that this game will do. It was implied how joel read the room, thought somey was off and even awkwardly tried to explain how they should leave quickly. Joel didn't just walk into a place, and hang out with a bunch of strangers. There was a process that was then emphasized by the production/acting to get to his death.

Of course the plot doesn't hit you as hard the second time.

She would never in a million years play the game - she wouldn't even like the game, honestly, because spending hours sneaking past and killing infected just doesn't appeal to her.

comments discussing story of the game,"If the goal of the analysis is to analyze the difference in between how TV can tell a story and how a video game can tell a story then you can absolutely still properly analyze it.
Both this and the OP’s other post are doing just that, discussing the technique video games have that TV just can never have- interactivity. Analyzing the impact interactivity had on storytelling is a fascinating topic, and I don’t think playing the game first means that it can’t be properly done.
Furthermore, thats ultimately a moot point because we are all biased. Everyone’s opinion on literally anything is inherently biased- it is completely unavoidable. Should we dismiss the criticisms book readers had of GoT? Should we say that no one in France can properly analyze French government because they are biased? Of course not.
It is, of course, wise to be aware of people’s biases and take them into account, but we shouldn’t say that one can’t analyze something solely because of bias.

comments discussing story of the game,"<sarcasm> I'm glad that was a honest reaction. There's been so many dishonest ones with people lying about what their opinions are. </sarcasm>
The complaints in the 1:1 comparisons are precisely why so many changes were made. It's not about which delivery was better. You're already familiar with the game's scenes. It's what you know and expect, so in any scenes that copy the game, you're going to see any deviations as something wrong.
All of us who have played the game are looking at it with that bias. It will be interesting to see people who first saw the story in the show play the game and see if they feel the game or the show was superior in those scenes. I'd bet they prefer the show's versions since it will be what they already know.
My own opinion is that gameplay will tend to involve people more. You're not watching Joel and Ellie. You ARE Joel (or Ellie) and you're experiencing their journey first hand and not just a spectator. That will change your perspective. The important thing is the show allows an entirely new audience who isn't into video games to fall in love with the same story we've fallen in love with over and over.",0.6427679657936096

comments discussing story of the game,"This is very interesting and at points compelling—until the point where you compare game scenes and show scenes 1:1 and declare how each feels. ""That's just, like, your opinion, man,"" and I think you're letting your original experience of the game tint your view of each.
I loved the games, but clearly it didn't hit me nearly as hard as it hit a lot of people in this sub. I don't find myself having such strong reactions to one line here or there as I see in this sub, and I think that's OK—it's cool to see people waiting to see certain things that I'd completely forgotten happened—but I also think that those things stick with you because they hit you a certain way at a certain time in your life and you can never replicate that, and while it's great that art does that for people, it's not really a great way to compare things because it's so distinct for every person.
I loved the show, too. I do think there were things they could've done better, and I think simply by nature of immersing yourself in a game for many, many times longer, you're obviously likely to get some more feeling of growth and attachment than the show would ever have been able to portray. I think they did a really good job, but nothing's perfect and there's always room for improvement that's worth discussing.
I think a lot of people liked the games as action games, and so a lack of infected in the show was disappointing to them like it wasn't to me (as I age, I actually want less action in my media—it tends to be the least-interesting thing on screen, for me), but I also think the criticism that the infected were too sparse is fair—they are, after all, the reason Ellie needed protection, and the whole reason for the journey at all.
I think that's my biggest agreement with the criticism I've heard. The other stuff really just feels to me like someone who placed the games in a very special place in their heart, and nothing will ever take that away, and that's great, but it's not a particularly level-headed analysis of the adaptation.",0.6190294027328491

Based on a lot of the comments I’ve read here, it really does feel a bit split on which medium executed it better. Ig it’s just personal preference. But bruh I just love the game’s so much more. The music not being loud in the show peeves me off a bit more than it should",0.6078119277954102
comments discussing story of the game,"I don’t disagree with much of anything you said, my two cents is just that games have a lot of, how do I say this…
When a gamer plays a game, the gameplay is the point and story is fluff.
On TV it’s flipped. I would have enjoyed seeing more infected fights, but that’s gameplay. It’s fluff on TV. It’s why most people don’t like watching others play a game. We’d rather be playing ourselves instead of watching.
Meanwhile, in the game, there’s so much gameplay that there’s tons of places to insert fluff(story) to build characters over a lengthy (much longer than a show) period of time.
So of course the game hits harder. And the show could / should have had a few more episodes. To their credit, though, the show cut nearly all the fluff(gameplay).",0.6125088930130005

comments discussing story of the game,"I played the game for the first time just before starting to watch the show. In my opinion, I thought certain scenes hit harder in the show than the game. But part of that is that it took me well into the game to start enjoying the gameplay. I was playing for the story primarily. Maybe it’s just that the gameplay is starting to show its age, but it felt clunky and unresponsive, and it was difficult for me to look past it. So watching the show without that added frustration let me just enjoy the story and the character development.
All that said, I do agree that there probably should have been more time dedicated to fleshing out their relationship in the show (and honestly more infected.) I wouldn’t say their scenes felt unearned to me, but I had the context of the game influencing how I was seeing the show. I think the show was exceedingly well done, though slightly flawed.",0.6028784513473511
comments discussing story of the game,"After the fourth episode I realized that I was not feeling any connection with the characters and would involuntarily miss the game so I dropped it. Maybe after some time I'll give it a watch because I can literally narrate both of the damn games in my head. I was not that excited for that very reason as well.

comments discussing story of the game,"Agreed 100000%. Very well formulated thought here. The strongest parts of the show were the new parts, but ultimately this reduced the grace and impact of the original story.
There was also a general lack of underlying tension from the infected as soon as they left Kansas City. The importance of Ellie's immunity dwindled slightly with this, which also reduced the significance of Joel's (and Marlene's) choices in the end. Part of what made the game so special was its ability to polarize audiences in this dilemma, but at the same time have audiences nearly universally love the narrative and its characters.",0.6091656684875488

I agree with your take btw.
It’s a hard piece of media to adapt, for sure. I’m not sure he’s really tried to adapt the Ellie story in the way I understood it, though. That’s ok. It’s his creative vision.

comments discussing story of the game,"This was a very thoughtful post. 
There are two elements that seem to predict how people respond to the game. 
You've identified the first in your post: discomfort. The story is ugly, difficult, emotionally complex and asks the player to sit in feelings that are generally accepted to be 'bad'. It causes us to feel uncomfortable about how easily we can be swept into poor judgement and when faced with discomfort, we can either look within to the cause, or blame outward. For many, media is entertainment meant for comfort, so they feel betrayed by the developers. Part II is art.
The response by u/bakuhatsuda identifies the other: attention. This story demands your focus and to be immersed so that you resist the ego-protecting instinct to 'switch off' and blame the game for making you uncomfortable. The pacing of dialogue and the lingering camera and the haunting score are all in service of lengthening the time we have to weigh our own emotions against what we're experiencing. Without attention, it's impossible to connect and it's particularly bad for people streaming the game who are conditioned to react and interact, rather than to contemplate and respond.
So can you have empathy without being able to 'suffer' discomfort or being able to pay attention to the emotions of others? 
It's interesting that you feel that Korean gaming culture really latched onto hating this game. Forgive me, but as an urban Canadian, my impression is that in a lot of ways Korea can be as extremely hyper capitalist as America. The cutting edge of materialistic/consumerist culture worships comfort and demonizes 'trying too hard' or giving a lot of care an attention to things unrelated to money or 'success'. Given that baseline for a culture, is it surprising that online-forward communities are so reactively hateful toward this game?
I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm glad to hear from another person very far from me that they felt the intense humanity of this experience. You've written about vulnerability and empathy with thoughtfulness and kindness. I hope more people read your post. Thank you",0.6465424299240112

comments discussing story of the game,"Your perspective is so interesting to me, because I have felt since i've played this game that my time spent in therapy definitely colored how I interpreted the themes and plot of the game.
I sort of view the denial of Joel's death, and the very strong reaction to be akin to the grieving of a real person that people felt they lost. I think it shows just how much people love these characters. People see what the game was trying to do, and still don't want to forgive what Abby did. Even though deep down they know it's probably the right thing to do, the anger just feels too difficult to let go of. It's also just really hard to see Ellie struggle like she did. It was a hard game to process. I don't blame anyone who found it too much to go through at some level.
I feel, however, that my years spent in therapy getting over my own angers and hurts and injustices I've felt I've gone through in my life primed me to more readily accept what was happening in the game. Forgiveness is never an easy task and it feels like you're letting the other person off the hook, but that's a facade. That's why the saying goes ""forgiveness is not for the other person, it's for yourself."" You have to remind yourself why you're doing it, and also that it doesn't mean you completely forget about what happened. You just stop holding on to the pain.
The Girlfriend Reviews video for this game said it best ""there is no difficulty setting in the game or in life that makes forgiving someone easier"" and even better ""if you finished the game wishing Ellie killed Abby, you may have won the game you were playing with your controller, but you may have lost the game Naughty Dog was playing with your soul.""
The game is hard because it's like life. Tragic things happen that don't make sense and are needlessly cruel and unfair. To bring that into a game, which is supposed to normally be for escapism, is a ballsy move. Also, life is inherently full of uncertainty. Everyone you meet, and even ourselves, are morally grey characters full of good things and bad things. You play games often to get away from these harsh realities, so for them to put it into a game was bound to be divisive. But I don't personally play video games very often because of that escapism element, they help me run from my problems too much. So I went in for the sake of a great story, and boy did I get it.",0.6046148538589478

Ps. Fu** Abby. 🤣",0.6349803805351257
comments discussing story of the game,"I agree so much with your take on the game. It's a masterpiece that makes people feel things in a way most other stories don't (not just games). If there's any artistic justice in the world, games like this will grow to become essential art that gets assigned to high school or college kids like the literary classics of the past. Yeah, I felt negative emotions during this game, but demanding only positive emotions from art is ridiculous. Imagine saying a breakup album is bad because it should have been all happy songs.
I agree that fandom is a problem too, though I'm not sure I agree 100%. It almost feels like your implication is that criticism of a thing by consumers is bad, and only the author can have any valid opinion on what characters would or wouldn't do. I certainly give the author's view precedence over others, but I wouldn't say they're always right by definition. This gets even more complicated when it's a branded thing and the original creator isn't involved. For example, I think the Star Wars prequels are terrible, but you can at least argue that Lucas was involved and the choices carry more weight for that reason. By the time you get to The Last Jedi, the Star Wars brand is really more about selling stuff than telling any kind of story that the creator of it feels must be told.
It seems like the view many fans take is that because something is called X and I identify as a fan of X, the art in question is automatically good if it's labeled as X. I believe this tendency to like anything labeled as X can be worse than the hipster-y tendency to hate things labeled as X because ""I'm a fan of the original X."" It's an especially insidious form of gatekeeping. You see this often in fandoms. ""You're not a real MST3K fan if you don't like Jonah exactly as much as Mike and Joel"" or ""You don't actually like wrestling if you prefer AEW and New Japan over WWE."" (These are admittedly very niche, but I'm sure we've all seen examples of this sort of thing - and maybe been guilty of it ourselves.) No one says those exact words, but they are opinions that can be enforced on a community through actions and implications.
This cuts both ways too. If someone blindly defended this game because ""it's The Last of Us and Neil Druckmann is always right,"" I wouldn't be any more convinced than I am by ""The Last Jedi is brilliant because Star Wars is always right."" Let's argue on the merits. It's always fair to criticize art and, while different people can (and will) come to different views, it's okay to think some art is good and other art is bad. That's how we learn to tell better stories and/or to identify good stories - or, at least, what we believe makes a good story.
I don't think you'd actually disagree with any of that, but I do think there's probably a little bit of space between our views, so hopefully I've articulated it well enough to provide a slightly different perspective.",0.6691423654556274
comments discussing story of the game,"I think you articulated yourself quite well! It was definitely an interesting perspective. ☺️
I definitely don’t want to imply that criticism from fans or consumers is a bad thing. I do think art is subjective and everyone’s opinion on the material matters. I agree that the creator’s view does take precedence over fan’s desires, but like you stated, it doesn’t make them right. I’m definitely not in the camp of “Neil Druckmann is always right” as that is definitely another unhealthy extreme.
I guess what I was trying to say is that there’s critiquing art and then there’s complaining about “I expected X to happen and it didn’t so this sucks”. I’ve read several reviews for the game, some who give it a 6/10 or so, and I can definitely see where they are coming from! I think there’s several reviews and valid criticisms from fans of the game, but the ones who take it to the extreme of “We wanted this and you didn’t give it to us, so you suck” are, I feel personally, flooding a lot of the negative reviews of this game.
I hope that makes sense? But like you said, I think we agree for the most part. Fandom is a beautiful thing that can definitely be integrated into the art form in some way, but when pleasing fans takes precedence over story, I begin having an issue with that.",0.637294352054596

We consume art because we appreciate the vision of the story-teller, but I feel this is something that has been forgotten over time.
I actually feel like it has never truly been present in gaming as a medium.

comments discussing story of the game,"This was a wonderful read and a great character study of Ellie. I love the level of detail you went into, not only in your analysis of the story but in the various quotes, photos and references you've included in your post. And your style of writing is really lyrical and lovely to read.
I don't have much to add except that I totally agree that while this game may seem to be about hatred and violence, it's more about love, healing and acceptance. I especially like your analysis of the porch scene as signifying the moment where Ellie fully realises the weight of what Joel wanted for her: not just to be his daughter, but to be alive and happy and thriving for her own sake.
What gives a meaning to our life in that kind of society ? And the game cleary give one answer : the love we have for and from others [...] a life of meaning is a life made with someone else
Totally agree. We see it with Jackson, with Ellie and Dina, with Abby and Lev - it's through human connection that people find a way to survive meaningfully in a world like this. And that's what makes these games so heartfelt and compelling, even at the darkest moments, imo - because of those relationships.
I also love your final point that another thing the game shows us is: it's never too late to come back from the edge. You can get lost in the darkness but the light is always there if we can find our way back to it. It's so simple but such a lovely message - no matter what, we always have room to grow and change for the better.",0.6136536598205566
comments discussing story of the game,"Oh yeah, I also hate when people are saying that the lesson here is simply : revenge is bad. If you take the time to try to understand this game, you realize how amazing and deep it is ! No act is out of character. It's just complex, subtle, and terribly human.",0.612326979637146
comments discussing story of the game,"What you pulled from the game is beautifully written here! I don’t think you could have expressed yourself here any better!
The thoughts that have been in my head about a month after I finished the game have NOT been able to leave me. It really resonated with me and a lot of the things you wrote have stirred in my own mind for days on end.
I don’t know if I could have put it into words so eloquently and I think there are even some things that you said that I didn’t even consider! But by and large this is EXACTLY my interpretation of the game. Very well done sir!",0.6728442907333374

comments discussing story of the game,"What a wonderful write up. Maybe the best assessment of Ellie's journey and mindset that I've seen so far. Take my gold award and if you dont mind I added this to my reddit page full of analysis for the game. Absolutely deserved.

comments discussing story of the game,"Yesss! I've been saying it for a while, but I was just so impressed by how every flashback in the game provided new context for Ellie's motivations and state of mind. Each one changed the status quo and how I perceived Ellie's actions that I was complicit with. (Abby's did too, just not quite as much since we didn't spend a whole game with her before.) It was a serious gold-standard in non-linear storytelling that still has me emotionally shaken.",0.6017352342605591

""Your life does matter. You have valued beyond your immunity. I saved you... because you were worth saving."". Man, I think you have perfectly resumed Joel's thought during the scene.

I think that’s what people were bummed about, because the first game had its ugly moments, but in the end it was about love and father-daughter relationships and hope, the second part is darker, but it still tells an amazing story that stays with you for quite some time. It makes you feel disgusted and angry at times at characters, while you still have a deep understanding for their motives.

Edit: just felt like adding one extra opinion, as I saw many comments complimenting this games central point. The point is to end the cycle of violent, but in order to push this point across, they sacrifice a plot driven by the characters.

I know I'm clearly in the minority, but I was pretty shocked at how drab and poorly-paced TLOU2 is in contrast with how much folks were gassing it up. Also doesn't help that the narrative doesn't trust in the player's intelligence - almost like a dog getting its nose rubbed into its own shit with how badly the game insists on telling and not showing.
I dunno, I just think there's way more indie titles that run laps around TLOU2 when I think of ""ground-breaking video game narrative.""",0.6062753796577454

comments discussing story of the game,"Crossposting from a comment on /r/television:
I need someone to give me a rundown of what was so good about the writing in this game. I played it once and remember it being fairly rote (til the ending) and perfunctory, nothing about it felt all that complex or inspired.
Where I really thought it shine was in the direction and production. It is a beautiful game with stunning art direction, atmosphere and a fully realised world. Performances were pretty terrific.
But yeah the writing is held up by gamers as being some sort of literary masterpiece, but it's just the same general beats from infinite other post apocalyptic stories, and the characters were incredibly likeable without being all that complex. I honestly barely remember any details about them other than Joel was gruff and Ellie was a kind of resourceful, plucky kid. Are gamers just not that well read or something? I'm so baffled. People acting like this game was written by Shakespeare himself or like Eugene O'Neill or someone.
EDIT: I really gotta expand on this because it's genuinely making me crazy. So, I don't have an English degree. I read a lot, but I'm no Joan Didion. I watch a lot of movies, and I love certain TV shows, particularly shows with richly textured characters like The Sopranos. I recognise good writing when I see it, as many of us do - it's layered, ambiguous, but very specific and truthful, it begins to feel alive after a while, draw you in with things you can relate to and recognise that you otherwise may never have seen. Style is also a factor, and when aiming for something very specific it can all by in the style, like certain scenes or characters in The Sopranos carrying a weight that they wouldn't otherwise if the exact language, phrases and intentions were not accurately portrayed. You BELIEVE in Tony, Christopher, Paulie because you RECOGNISE them, they're real people, they exist. Likewise, the world around them has a pulse, it feels like a self-sustaining organism that exists with or without them. I don't really know if I'm making sense, but what I DO know is that it's probably the greatest written show of all time, though I've never seen the Wire. What I hear, though, is that The Wire is every bit its equal.
I guess what I'm saying is that the more literary, ie. truthful, earnest, ambiguous and yet specific that something like a TV show can be, the more successfully it can dramatise things so minute like pulp in orange juice and use that to build WHOLE LIVES that you come to recognise yourself in... the better the writing, right?
Where on Earth do people get off thinking a kinda awesome zombie game with a likeable duo at the heart of it, killing people with bricks but barely expanding on who they are... is somehow in the upper echelon of works of literary merit? Who truly believes this that aught to know? Anyone? Or is it just fanboys online?
EDIT 2: I also gotta add another little condition of great writing - revelation. The writer actually revealing something they truly believe, have experienced, have gone through, ARE going through that makes the writing that much more pungent and truthful. An honest reflection of internal life as a representation of an external life. Using emotion to fuel imagination and create something real.
Watching The Sopranos with the knowledge that David Chase created it because he ""needed therapy"" and that he based Livia on his mother, you begin to understand why it came out swinging so hard. It really was what he was going through. His NJ upbringing, Tony's struggle to comprehend his own mind, to contend with his demons... it's all a real human being's internal life being dramatised for our enjoyment.
Sam Shepard said ""catharsis is getting rid of something. I'm not trying to get rid of my demons. I want to shake hands with them."" His work is just that - shaking hands with his demons. Some of his darkest thoughts must have gone into his work because he goes to some fucking emotionally harrowing places.
Why do people think Neil Druckmann is some sort of Nobel Laureatte? Even Ann Rice managed to dramatise the loss of a child in her first book and it SHOWS. Where in TLOU has Druckmann told us anything so revealing about himself?

Gamers don't actually know what is and isn't ""writing,"" because they obviously aren't reading it. The game just had such an incredible level of verisimilitude that they latched onto its storytelling as some sort of work of written genius.

comments discussing story of the game,"TLOU2 has showed how immature the fanbase is
Yesterday i was reading a post saying something like “buying TLOU2 for 9,99 dollars was the worst spending of my life: i should have bought toilet paper instead”. Hundreds of like and comment with the same, old hate to the game.
I mean, come on guys… it’s ok if you don’t like the plot of a game, but this “criticism” is beyond any rationality. It’s nothing new, i mean: since the beginning, this game has received A LOT of immotivated hate, simply because of a plot decision (Joel’s death).
This game is by far one of the best of all time, not only for its amazing gameplay and graphics, not only because the wonderful combat system or the true survival horror experience on higher difficulty (i mean, if you like the genre TLOU2 on survivor or grounded is AMAZING). But also because the most hated aspect: the plot. The story of this game is deep and complex, the characters are not “flat” and the game puts you in front of the reality of the non existence of “good” and “evil”, but only of action and consequences. A lot of people hate this game because you play Abby, but this is the best part of this game: you live two stories, you understand both reasons, you empatize with two opposite characters which are also e enemies. The whole point of the game is the relativity of things, a fact that is part of our world and even more of a post-apocaliptic world.
I mean, TLOU2 has its flaws, in both the world setting and plot, like barely every game, but the story of this game is very deep, profound and let you through an emotional amazing experience. With the amazing gameplay and post apocaliptic world exploration, that’s really barely everything you can ask from a game like this!!!
The hate for this game has showed, sadly, how immature the fanbase is: the fact that a complex story, with a gray reality in which there isn’t a clear “good” and a clear “evil”, has create a crisis in those who usually see the reality in black and white. Also, it’s a common part of human nature the fact that we feel being part of a “side” (“team Ellie” or “team Abby”), and trying to open your mind to the “other side” is difficult but it’s part of a person’s maturity. Having to deal with the need of open your mind to the other side, and empatize with a character that you hate for half of the game, is one of the best( if not THE best) aspect of TLOU2, and it should also be considered a pedagogic videogame experience from a psicological and moral point of view.
Maybe, many people still want to play a SuperMario game, with the hero saving the princess killing the incarnation of the evil.
If you don’t like the plot decision to kill Joel i totally understand it (rip Joel ♥️) but overcriticizing and hating this game simply because of this, without considering the whole story and game experience, it’s really a brainless fanbase type of behaviour.
It’s really not a good thing for the future of videogames industry, the fact the people hate this game because it’s a complex story with complex characters and a “two sides” plot.",0.6040144562721252

comments discussing story of the game,I'm glad that you played the game for yourself and came to your own conclusion. I'm glad you mentioned the point of view of the characters.

comments discussing story of the game,"I loved the first game but went into this one with really low expectations because of all the negative feedback it was getting at launch ... and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

After my question you used another edgy 12-year-old trend. Triggered. Meanwhile, making claims that certain responses would apply that term to me while you yourself pull off those exact responses.

comments discussing story of the game,"Reminds me of IGN reviews where they mostly shit on a game then give it a 7.5 or an 8.
""Terrible gameplay, mediocre story, meh visuals, framerate drops, too many glitches. 8/10, it has a little something for everyone.""
If you presented some of these 10/10 reviews to me without a score, and asked me to guess what score they gave the game, I'd have to guess somewhere between 78-95, depending on the review. Still a good or great review, just not a top game (well 95 still would be) of all time, based on the review wording.
The unscored reviews also seem to have a more negative tone that the scored ones. Not that they're all extremely negative or anything, but Polygon's review, Kotaku's, Skill Up's, etc. are especially harsh on the story, though I find Polygon's review a bit tedious. Now I think I'll like the game more than SkillUp or these outlets, since I personally liked the combat more than they did.
I'm certain this is still a very good game though, and I can't put down any judgement until I play. But this definitely reminds of a handful of other games that explode to 93-96 review scores, where the reviews themselves seem to be less positive than their score would make you think. If you compare the 100 review scores for this game to some other games with 100 review scores, and used that as a baseline, I would never guess that some of these TLoU2 reviewers gave the game a perfect score.",0.6002142429351807

comments discussing story of the game,"Nice review, it's nice to see that inclusivity mattered.
I would just like to remind you that there's no black and white as to why people dislike the game's story. There's a vocal minority of incels bashing the game for a handful of reasons, but there's plenty of people that have gripes with the story and their gripes are kinda believable and have nothing to do with LGBTQ representation.
I've always been middle ground, I think TLOU2 is a superb game that anybody needs to experience and I'm happy I played it, but it didn't resonate with me the way the first game did.
It might be because I'm a cishet white male, but I don't think so, I'm definitely not an incel. I've never been bothered by LGBTQ representation, the more the better. My main issue is that I didn't like Abby that much as a character. Not because ""she killed my beloved Joel!1!1!!"", not because she was a muscle woman, just because I didn't like her attitude, her way of dealing with problems. I did think that her side of the story went on for a little bit too long and deviated from what, for me, was the fulcrum of the story.
But TLOU2 is still a gripping, tight, wonderful game deserving of all the possible praise.
The thing is, people who didn't like the game and aren't sad homophobic incels are actually much more than you might think, and are open for dialogue and bashing them by grouping them together with a very loud minority isn't really fair and it generally leads to the usual back and forth
""I like the game, people who don't like it are homophobes""

That being said (and this is coming from someone who thought Part I was overall better than Part II), I actually enjoyed the gameplay and combat sequences.

Not everyone is going to agree on how good or bad this game is. It just won't happen. People have their opinions and are entitled to them.

comments discussing story of the game,"Nice effort.
However I'm not a fan of using foreign (to videogames) tools to justify a story. TLOU feels nothing like a magic trick. That would be like saying ""Two basketball teams will face each others twice in the season, once at home and the other time as visitors."" in order to justify Nier Automata flipped playthroughs.
About the actual story, feels like you're just over-analyzing. I've seen much more complex stories in cinema get much less complicated posts. I love TLOU, but the story itself is nothing new. And that's perfectly fine. The game benefits from some of the best acting in videogames though.",0.60130774974823
comments discussing story of the game,"I think your interpretation is a plausible one--there are a lot of emotions roiling in the final scene. I'm sure Ellie didn't want to let Joel down, so that could've contributed to it. Her remembering Joel, thinking about the relationship they had, could've also led her to think about Abby and Lev's relationship (when Ellie lets Abby go, she explicitly tells her to take Lev, so we know he's at least in her thoughts, even given the intensity of the situation). And if she's thinking of Lev, she's sure to remember that he saved her and Dina when Abby was ready to end it.
I agree with you about the quality of the story. There are certain facets of the game that are intentionally designed to make the player feel uncomfortable, but that (for me) does not detract from the overall narrative. It is certainly not perfect, but it is thoughtfully crafted, ambitious in its breadth, and a worthy sequel to the original.",0.6181188225746155
comments discussing story of the game,"I've posted this elsewhere but a huge theme of the story is overcoming bias. Getting to know Abby too much before THAT scene would completely defeat the purpose of the theme. We are supposed to have extreme bias and hatred for her throughout most the game in the same way Ellie does. The order of the presentation is intentional as a way to say ""okay you have your bias, but here is some new information"" and the challenge to you as a player from then on is to be able to overcome that bias and view things more objectively.
You may or may not, and it's okay because a narrative like this is supposed to make different players feel different ways. Some were able to overcome that bias fully and root for Abby, even to the point of rooting for her more so than Ellie. Others were still die hard team Ellie and wanted to see Abby dead at the end despite that not being what would have been best for Ellie. Then you have some people that are 50/50. Fully understanding, even empathizing with Abby but still wanting to see Ellie get her vengeance.
There was a very intentional point to how the two playthroughs are presented and I think anything else would have greatly diminished a central, powerful theme of the narrative",0.6336641907691956
comments discussing story of the game,"Interesting take. I never saw one of the story’s theme as overcoming bias. I always felt like the themes were more that violence begets violence and that vengeance will cost you everything. You are on point with the Team Ellie or Team Abby thing. I’ve always felt for Ellie the entire time, maybe because I connected with Joel a lot and loved his character so much. But had friends that really loved Abby and felt like Ellie was being completely out of control and unreasonable.

comments discussing story of the game,"I've not played the game as I don't have a PS but watched both games through YouTube playthroughs and I actually think it gave me a unique perspective. I adored the story (I thought the gameplay looked fine but obviously can't judge as I didn't play it myself and some said it gets repetitive). But I understand the hate now. I think this is the most ambitious and divisive possible way to have made the sequel and I give props to Naughty Dog for that. However, others who actually had to play as Abby for half the game and didn't like her..... Jesus I feel sorry for them.
As a passive viewer, this was one of the greatest experiences I've ever got from gaming (like the first one was) but for all the fan boys who worshipped Joel for 7 years and dreamed of their sequel, I sincerely hope they all emotionally recover because this game will get a very different reception in 10 years without the hype and with both games being played back to back like you did. I'm not picking sides purely based on future predictions but I do think the game will have so much more appreciation in about 5 years minimum.
Regarding common complaints about the story, I think on paper as a script the story is undoubtedly amazing but the way it is presented and how the gamer interacts with it can completely go the other way. People say Joel's death was unrealistic but he did trust several people in the first game (everyone just talks about the one fake injury man) and also gave his name willingly multiple times. The idea he wouldn't have trusted Abby (short term) considering the situation of the horde and blizzard, is utterly ridiculous and a sign of people who just can't accept that Joel died. It's like my 4 year mourning period over (GAME OF THRONES SPOILER ALERT) Stannis when I just kept saying it was terrible writing. Then after watching it all again and ignoring the books, I thought the arc was incredible despite the pain the viewer experiences. People who just say Abby is a ""weak character"" with no basis are obviously biased because they just don't like her.
However, there are many real story and gameplay criticisms that are valid opinions and I can see scores for this ranging realistically from 5 to 10 out of 10. I would call this a 10 and my favourite example of true artistry and risk in gaming but some others will hate it and call it 5. That is life. I love watching the shit storm online. This is living in the times of the premieres of Beethoven's Grosse Fugue or Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. Not saying TLOU2 is a genius masterpiece and will be hailed by everyone in 10 years but it will keep growing in appreciation and people will always remember the controversy at release. Some people still hate those music pieces today and some will hate TLOU2 in 10 years. But I hope I won't get lynched online in the future for just saying I actually loved the story.",0.6095760464668274

The golf club represents a golf club.

comments discussing story of the game,"Well it boggles my mind that you have given the game so much adoration.
Thats what a difference of opinion is.
I find that those who feel the way that you do are mostly latecomers to the series.
I guess drastic changes to character dynamics and a less interesting story are easier to swallow if you aren't very invested in the franchise from the off.
I assume you are a fan of other franchises and are invested in the characters and lore?
Think of your favourite film series or game series.
Now imagine if the next installment to that series took nearly a decade to come out, and when it did, it looked and felt near identical (albeit better looking) to the last installment and no real innovation had taken place.
Then imagine the characters you know and love were rewritten to be nothing like they were up to this point and one of the main protagonists is killed off early in the first act, merely to make way for a new character. Then, In order to ingratiate this new character to the audience, you are forced to watch/play as said new character for 1/3 of the time.....in a piece of media....you have waited nearly 10 years....to get hold of.
Then imagine that the reputation and drivers of the character that was killed were tarnished and vilified in order to further the idea that this new character is the real 'hero' in the story. Even though you have replayed the previous installment over and over and the thematic was centred around moralistic shades of grey and self serving actions in the name of love and endearment, you are now forced to disregard this in order to make the new piece fit.
Many hate the game because it takes a dump on the first one.

comments discussing story of the game,"i said i didnt want to get into arguments. people have been pretty nasty when talking about this game and i just wanted to have a discussion, not get cussed out online.
granted i played the game months after release, i didnt hear anything about bugs or UI problems. my playthrough was as technically sound as any game i've ever played. the UI/UX was everything i needed it to be while being minimal as possible. the presentation and transition from cut scenes to live gameplay was smooth and as seamless as i've seen since God of War.
Joel was overly cautious in part 1, but they were also being chased by a hoard of infected and if they didnt flee with abby to their cabin, they all would have died from the infected. also, people make mistakes, which i think is a major theme of the game overall. there's a also a difference between a grown man in the middle of the road claiming his car broke down (as a trap for an ambush in the first game) and seeing a teenage girl with an infected on top of her. was this the absolute strongest possible way to get abby to joel, maybe not, but is is far from game breaking.
joel did save abby, but in the eyes of a child who's father was murdered, i'm not sure that all is just immediately forgiven. abby was consumed by revenge, she spent 4 years training to be a killer and ruined relationships in favor of following leads and then traveled nearly 1000 miles in the winter to find joel. upon suddenly hearing his name and realizing who he was, i can only imagine all the years of pent up hate and anger came rushing forward and the idea he saved her was the last thing on her mind.
i think you're reading too much into the dog thing. ellie was fighting the WLF, who had dogs. abby was part of the WLF, who had dogs. it seemed far more like a new game play mechanic to add enemies who could track your movement than some ploy to make ellie less likable. with or without dogs, abby was justified in killing joel, from her perspective.
the them is revenge is bad, but forgiveness, salvation and redemption are also themes. i was especially relieved when ellie let abby go. the game had made its point, everything abby was close to died because of her actions. abby also lost a close friend in jesse and ultimately her girlfriend and family for continuing to go after abby. ellie was only ever able to see joel in her mind being killed and it wasnt until she let the cycle of violence go, that she was able to see joel happy and alive in her mind. after all the killing, all the PTSD, everything she realized it didnt get her anywhere. as abby was seconds from death, she didnt feel better. what better way to say ''revenge is bad'' than to show her only personal salvation coming by letting the revenge go?
i dont see killing a main character as a cheap plot device, i see it as emotional motivation to carry out a story about revenge. joel was a beloved character, but ultimately, a fairly boring one. his arc was the highlight of the first game, from cold ruthless killer to redeemed father figure. just as in game of thrones, killing a loved main character leaves far more interesting options than basing the game around him again. his absents creates a vacuum that is far more interesting to fill.
they did the build up in reverse through flashbacks and having played the first game, once you know abby is jerry's daughter there's plenty of build up knowing joel killed him. creating a tragic and shocking moment early in the game sets the stage for a raw, emotional journey and creates instant hate for abby. they wanted you hate abby intensely which leads into my next point:
hating abby as much as i did and then being made to play her i dont see as manipulation, i see it as understanding and empathizing. joel was the villain of abby's story and eventhough she savagely killed joel, you can't play as her for 10 hours and not at least understand where that came from. i went from hating her so much, and feeling motivated to kill anyone in ellie's way to get to her, to genuinely hoping she survived at the end. i see that as an emotional journey, rather than manipulation. people were free to continue to hate her, but at least the game gave you the information to decide for yourself. i do see an argument for giving the player a choice whether or not kill abby at the end. however, letting abby live wasn't about abby, it was about ellie. if ellie had killed abby, she'd be lost emotionally forever. by sparing abby, it spared ellie.
and i assume by breaking with previously established characters, you mean ellie not being a hardened killer in the first game. well, i'd imagine watching your father beaten to death with a golf club would change a person. abby didnt even see her father killed and it certainly changed her into a killer, blood thirst for revenge, at the cost of everyone around her. i also think ellie learning the truth about joel taking her out of the hospital changed her. she specifically told joel she didnt want her life to mean nothing and when she found out joel prevented her life from potentially saving humanity, that changed her too. even before joel's death, during the opening of the second game, you could already feel ellie's shift in personality. she's 4 years older, had been through hell and felt like she had little to live for/that her life's purpose was taken from her.",0.60908043384552

comments discussing story of the game,"I know I'm years late, but this is just a masterpiece. You nailed everything about this game; the gameplay was absolutely amazing, the soundtrack and visuals made the game an experience, and the story is genuinely perfect. The hate for this game is so incredibly undeserved, I feel that at least half of it (if not more) truly does just come from how much was leaked about it.",0.6263452172279358
comments discussing story of the game,"That is definitely true as well! They made a bold move by killing a character we love, and yet they managed to make it pay off heavily even if many can't recognize it. This game still blows my mind with how well written it is; the fact that NaughtyDog really managed to make people who truly paid attention (not that I mean to sound condescending to haters, but if you're involved with the story properly, you'll understand your parallels as a player to Ellie) do a full 180 from wanting Abby dead on sight to wishing she could just back out of the final fight is amazing.
I also read through a ton of replies and you only make good points. They didn't butcher Joel's character, they expanded on it. They showed us more of who Joel truly is when he can let the hardened shell around him wear down. He's still a threat in the apocalypse; anyone who played the game watched him rip through a Bloater with a machete. We just see him soften up a bit to people (due to being surrounded by them for the last 4 or 5 years) and accidentally slip. I honestly don't think it's out of character, especially when looking at the Sam & Henry bits from Part 1, and that's before Joel settled down.
I know I'm just repeating a lot of what you said lol, but anyway, absolutely fantastic analysis. I'm so glad to see the game getting appreciation that it deserves, and I'm happy to see reception of it has changed over the years (albeit many still blindly hate). Thank you!

This game is, from the writing point of view, terrible, without exaggeration. From the game design and direction points of view, it's flawed.
I think people praising it are either wanting to see the emperor's clothes or confusing the misery porn this game is with a ""deep/very impactful"" story.

And have nothing to show for it. People pay money for complete products, not for a hollow sentiment of someone ""doing their best"".
They have a complete game on launch - they could have changed nothing and it would still have been a game that is fun to play and enjoyable. Adding all that they already have, on the very reasonable timeline that they have, with more and better things planned, with the huge launch, is commendable. Guess you've never heard of ""early access"" games.
Blowing hot air and swindling their fans, more like.
So first they don't communicate enough, then they communicate and it's not good enough? Just admit you're angry to be angry and move on.
A passionless blend of most popular Sci-Fi aesthetics, including Warhammer, Star Wars, Starship Troopers, and a smidge of Terminator.
Huh... a sci-fi thing inspired by... other sci-fi things? My oh my, this is the first time that has ever happened!
You have a very shallow scope if this is all that you see.
It's sure what seems to be popular and wins awards.
Why are you reusing my words without understanding what they mean? You aren't doing yourself any favors.
Not sorry you don't like when your ""sick own"" is turned around on you. It's what happens when you have no basis but emotion and poor judgement for your opinions.
The horrid bugs? Yeah, I'm quite happy they fixed the fire bug, for example. Otherwise... I've uh... crashed twice in... several hundred hours? So yeah, terrible.
God, at times it's almost disturbing how deluded white-knighting fanboys can be. This behavior is borderline cultish.
You do realize that is exactly how the review bombing hate-filled drivel that you're defended sounds too, right? You do understand that literally everything you've said can be said of the ""other side""? I sure hope you do.

You can include references to a character being LGBTQIA+ without using the exact words ""Hello Player, I am Queer,"" one time in the entire game. Perhaps he watches someone dressing a wound and calls out the improper use of chest bandages (""Not too tight around the chest now, it crushes the lungs. Trust me, I've made that mistake far too many times when binding. Thank goodness for proper binders these days.""), or he mentions being forced to wear a dress when he was younger and absolutely hating it (""Why would you be forced to wear a dress as a man?"" ""Well I didn't know that at the time.""), or he receives a letter from his parents, takes one look and immediately chucks it into a fire because it's got his deadname on it (you don't see the deadname ofc), or hell, if you take his armor off he has top surgery scars.

comments discussing story of the game,"It's a game that took a very creative and bold approach to its story but it felt more like it was in love with sniffing its own fart than anything else really. It's like - I can see, understand and somewhat appreciate what they tried to do, it's just one of those ideas that is much better on paper or as a case study than an actual story one reads / plays. It also featured elements that felt really ham-fisted and bloated the narrative too much which made it lose focus. It was an emotional roller-coaster but mostly because it put your emotions on rails. It didn't feel like you actually went through it, it was more like you watched it play out. I had no connection to anything happening.
The gameplay was pretty good though and there was a lot of attention to detail that showed high production value. But in the end... it's just a on the rails revenge story where I think something much deeper and more profound could've been instead with all the same basic story beats still intact. The way it actually was... it felt like forced melodrama and I still feel like people who thought this was some storytelling masterpiece have never read a novel more challenging / complex than Hunger Games or some other YA novel that was trendy.",0.6026976108551025

Playing through it once, it told a good story. It also played pretty well. Its highly polished, no real issues technically, had fun with it.
But that's where it stops for me. Once the story beats are all known, the game really starts to show that it's pretty...well, average is harsh, it's above that, but I just never found it doing anything that seemed particularly revolutionary. You go into an area, kill everyone there, and move on to the next one, until you hit a big set piece, then repeat. With the story still a mystery, that hooks you enough for that not to be an issue, but I've never been engaged with replaying for those reasons.",0.6526615619659424

comments discussing story of the game,"This is probably the most constructive and accurate feedback posted about the event yet. It's clear a lot of people making criticisms don't actually follow the lore and as a result often claim certain things that just flat out aren't true.
I agree with a lot of what you're saying here, particularly about the rookie and VN format. It really feels like the rookie was their attempt at getting non-lore fans to feel excited and connected to the story as it progressed but it really fails to do so in my experience. People who aren't interested in the lore aren't going to suddenly care if they get to make the occasional quip and people who ARE interested in the lore don't really care about a self-insert and just want to experience the characters and world.
The Marvel inspirations are VERY obvious with how the characters are handled as well. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it leaves some interactions feeling very cookie-cutter and cheesy at times (particularly with Olaf). The actual encounters with Viego feel very ham-fisted as well, every location feels more or less the same: Meet new sentinel, fight mist wraiths, encounter the fetter, Viego shows up, throws a Ruined champ at the group, leaves with fetter.
The lack of a central narrative team handling the event is also very evident. It feels like every team working on this had their own vision for the plot and didn't really communicate with the rest of the teams on a more cohesive plan.",0.6071598529815674

comments discussing story of the game,My mans wrote a 6818 word essay about a video game's lore,0.6627572774887085
comments discussing story of the game,"I would like to preface this by saying that I am really in awe of your effort to describe your points of which you brought forth a remarkable amount! Around 7k words, around 39k characters! Took me a while to read. Then again, I'm almost never on reddit, so idk if it's a common thing to write large paragraphs of text here when discussing stuff.
You seem to be knowledgeable in literature, its study, its tropes & very much attentive to details which I find very commendable (especially for a league player /sarcasm).
So I read your whole essay & all your arguments & points of criticism became very apparent to me almost immediately.
However I was left with that weird feeling of ""Well, somehow, I just don't care, I just like the story & the event (even though I admit the VN format is rather crusty, but at least better than in spirit blossom)"". My willing suspension of disbelief was not shattered, which is also the reason why after reading all of that I will probably still enjoy the event. (The only point that really hit a nerve was ""Why is Gwen alive, but not the other objects?"" but my gf suggested ""Maybe cuz she was made by Isolde herself"" & I was satisfied :P)
Now I am really curious why that is & what might be your opinion on that.
(Also, what is ""IP""? I had very much trouble with all your abbreviations, ""SI"" is ""Shadow Isles"", I guess?)",0.6206445693969727

comments discussing story of the game,"I knew what to expect from the gameplay after watching so many videos of web slinging and combat, and it became obvious that in terms of open world design it would get the same sort of reaction as Horizon: Zero Dawn (nothing revolutionary which leads to criticism but praise for how well executed it is) so the one thing I was worried about is whether the story would be engaging or not.
I loved the prequel novel and everything Insomniac have revealed so far about their Spider-Man so it's great to hear the story is anywhere from genuinely entertaining to outright fantastic. I'm already invested in their version of these characters and I can't wait to play through the story.
Reviews don't mean much to me beyond giving an indication of just how solid a game is e.g I didn't think God of War was a masterpiece but I knew it would be a good game, so I was just hoping these reviews would back up everything shown from the game so far as being fantastic and I'm glad to see that's the case with what is undoubtedly the game I've been most hyped for ever.",0.6157721281051636

comments discussing story of the game,"I hope you understand my meaning. I don't say spiderman looks bad, I am just saying, it's 7~8/10 game, which is fine, even great, but it's not a game that deserve that much hype.
This might be a simple phrasing issue but one should be careful about making such absolute statements when dealing entirely with their own opinion. I mean, it may only look like a 7~8/10 game to you personally but that means nothing to anyone else. As such, saying that the game that ""deserves"" that much hype makes it sound like you are not just saying that the game is not as good as some make it out to be but also that your opinion is somehow more important than that of others.
It is kinda like when someone says something is ""overrated"". If you have hung around this subreddit enough, you have probably heard more than a few people say that such and such popular game is ""overrated"" but all they are really saying with such a statement is that those who did really like said game don't like it as much as they think they do. That their opinion must somehow be poorly thought out.
You list some games that you think are ""perfect"" and that is great. Heck, I love some of those games myself but everyone is going to have a different list and for different reasons. No one person's list is more correct than another because opinions are not meant to account for everyone, just the person who holds said opinion.
This is where I actually value (at least some) professional game reviews (and not the stuff you find from gaming youtube pundits and the like). In some of the better game journalism outfits, there is a certain expectation to take a step back from one's own opinions and look at a game from a wider angle. To understand that sometimes a game is pretty good and that some will value it and some won't.
Look, there was a time when I overestimated the value of my opinions in a pretty big way. I remember lecturing people for listening to pop acts like The Backstreet Boys or similar. I would go on and on about how they should listen to ""real"" music and that there is no good reason for modern pop acts to be popular. After a time, I found that it is not nearly as simple. It may baffle me that someone would want to go see a Miley Cyrus concert but those that enthusiastically do so are justified in their decision simply because they enjoy it. It is not my place to judge their taste and nor it is my place to judge the pop star for being a good pop star. I understand that I am not the intended audience and that my opinion in such matters means nothing as a result.",0.6110327839851379

If the scores were low then I would be hesitant to buy the game.
You don't just ignore the opinions of others, you try to understand them to make a choice.

comments discussing story of the game,"You said everything I wanted to say. Preach, brother.
I also have to mention the fact that this community is so reliant on video summaries to keep up with the plot. To me, it highlights just how poor AK's storytelling is that they dread the idea of reading the lore they claim to love, which few people would readily admit lest they would lose their privilege to claim to have read one of the most ""intelligent"" stories in the gacha market despite their meager experience in actually well-written gacha game stories.

TLDR is meant to be disparaging. It's also an appropriate response to bloated writing, which the OP calls out AK for.
I find it entirely reasonable when players say they don't read AK story. I have a few side events I haven't read yet too.
He wrote a bit more than just length critique. Besides, creative writing =/= analysis discussion.
Bloated analysis is no more desirable to read than bloated creative writing.
I note you aren't talking about the many points the OP brought up about AK's writing that related to my response. So muck for sparking a serious response and discussion.

Rather than a negative opinion, your whole essay is more like a ""here are some problem of Arknight and how to make it better"".

Edit: I see some people further down have a problem with ""forced"" diversity.

comments discussing story of the game,"I think the part that's frustrating for me as someone who loved the game (and also happens to write for a living), is that there's a difference between a narrative choice not working for you and calling a narrative choice ""terrible writing"".
u/brianstormIRL I'm not saying you're saying this as adamantly as other people I've seen, but the fact remains that a lot of people who are extremely against this game's narrative choices claim it has ""the worst writing ever"" and that's just not true.
This choice definitely worked for me, but I understand why it didn't work for others. I hated the switch to Abby at first, and looking back on it hours later, I love how I grew to feel about her as a character. Does this make me right and you wrong? No, not at all. People react to stories differently and that doesn't make the story ""good"" or ""bad."" On the other hand, there are legitimate ways to complain about writing, it's just a shame that with these highly divisive pieces of art (TLOU2 and The Last Jedi - another piece of bold storytelling I absolutely adored) it seems impossible for people to separate objective views and subjective views.
It comes down to amateur criticism becoming so hyperbolic that it's almost impossible to have a meaningful discussion. I think both of you ARE having a meaningful discussion right now, and that rules, but I see far too many arguments about this game that treat opinions as facts, and then narrative choices people don't agree with instead become ""sloppy, amateur writing and disrespectful to characters.""

Why would The Council simply not destroy the bugs? If they’re enemies, why play this out like God Vs The Devil in the bible and use Earth as a battle ground, why not go to war directly with them?
You said yourself earth isn’t special and there are a billion planets with life. Why would they arm us and risk their exposure or interfere with their experiment to save us when surely they have thousands of other experiments?
Why would the current geopolitics of the world carry on as they are? Surely Russia and the US and China would have put to bed Israel/Ukraine and other conflicts to prepare for what’s coming in 2 years time?
Why have the bugs chosen this experiment to interfere with?
How did our cousins start? Did they abduct 65,000 people or or just a few and 65,000 is the result of birth?
Were at over 8 billion people with a 2 billion increase almost in my own life time, surely with unlimited supplies and far superior knowledge and technology our cousins must have a crazy population? If I were The Council I’d leave earth to burn and focus on the Erids which surely is the new human civilisation?
You were inspired by the death of your friend who wanted to speak out about the truth which likely means provide evidence or credentials, yet you chose to post on Reddit with no proof and leave it at that? Why not go to congress yourself, show half an ID card, some paperwork, anything to prove you’re even remotely involved in these departments?

comments discussing story of the game,"I 100% agree they could be doing way more with the tools they have, or have more people dedicated to receiving this kind of feedback and even get to implement some later!
But...
You are being entitled. You don't work for Blizzard and they can do whatever they want with their game. You started this project of yours in hopes of getting recognized but you knew full well Blizzard is the last decision and the only one that matters.",0.6117646098136902

comments discussing story of the game,"75% of the OP's post history is about Genshin. This isn't an objective review in the slightest.
It's an entire dissertation about how this ""isn't as good as Genshin"" that is thinly veiled as a ""review.""
I don't understand why people are so insecure about competition as to go so far as to knock down anyone that is enjoying said competition.
People can like different games and can appreciate what one game does that another doesn't.
Saying ""there is not one thing this game does better than Genshin"" says everything about your attitude.
Stop pretending like you're being objective. You're not.",0.630509078502655

comments discussing story of the game,"Thanks, I'm looking forward to the new story!!
Some requests:
Can you expand the pre-story around The Noble and The Ox, especially for me The Ox because they were referring to a ton of things in their discussions that didn't hit emotionally for me because it was such an infodump/telling instead of showing
The Noble wasn't so bad for me but it would still be cool to get a little bit of previous story in the game to understand the gravity of what they're doing through more
Also
I would really like to re-read letters and notes from inventory instead of getting a summary of what it said",0.6260386109352112
