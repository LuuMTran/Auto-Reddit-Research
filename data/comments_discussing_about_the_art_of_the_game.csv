comments discussing about the art of the game,"We didn't need to catch up with everyone, because they can just paint in broad strokes and fill in the details later -- like they did with the game. People can intuit context based on how people act toward each other, what they say, what they don't.
Maybe that won't work for people who are on their phones while the show plays in the background, but fuck those people.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I, for one, love the show. I’ve played the games four times each, favorite games of all time. I don’t understand why people feel like the show has to be exactly like the game. It can be its own thing and still capture the essence of the game. I feel like the show is doing that pretty darn well, and I honestly feel like a lot of people are just so fragile and “hurt” every time an adaption isn’t executed exactly to their liking.

Amazing how well a review can detail a game in what other companies take six to seven pages to write. Give me this every time.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"What makes their opinion more valuable than anyone else’s? Because they work for Microsoft?
Their opinion is not more valuable than anyone else's. It's just more valuable than the army of salty fanboys who review bombed the game literally within hours of its release, where it was physically impossible to have finished the game.
But if you really want to know why these people deserve credibility, it's because their job is to specifically review games for the purpose of understanding why they're good (and bad). Their job is to inform Microsoft of the competition and instruct them on how Microsoft might be able to one-up them or at the very least match them. This review understood the game intimately, it seems, and was even more critical of its gameplay than most reviewers. They understood why it was so absolutely amazing and even gave advice on how developers might be able to steer their games in the future, narratively. This review was meant for internal use only and it had to be 100% honest. After all, why would Microsoft pay a team of people to review a game and lie about it? It makes no sense.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"As much as people here like to shit on Kotaku or Polygon, they have the right idea by not giving out scores to games.

""How good/bad"" is a reductive measure for art. The Kotaku review argued the point that the grim brutality of the game overpowers any other message or theme. That's a fair point. But, many people would say the same about the work of Cormac McCarthy or Dostoevsky. Hell, people said that about Red Dead Redemption 2 and Death Stranding (which I loved and finished, respectively.)

But if we want to accept that games can be art, then we need to accept that games reviews can exist as art critique, and that's what Polygon appears to be doing.
They're not just breaking down the graphics, sound, controls, story, and ""fun"" into 1-5 numerical ratings. They're taking the interactive story and giving it a chance to stand on it's own as a piece of art.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I don't know what statement they could make with that beyond showing the many possibilities of social/familial arrangements, but I think that's pretty cool on its own.
i think this is exactly the statement the game want to make. just within this post, there are argument about how men/women are DNA-coded to do certain things and fatherhood/motherhood is going to have only one path forward. my argument is to point out no, the game wants you to see that there are indeed many different possibilities of social/familial arrangements. And while we can judge whether one arrangement is good or bad based on different standards, we should recognize that we are reacting based on how we see the result of those arrangements on the children/the dependents. just take note of the reaction of Hornet and us as players when we relate to these characters.
Also, I think the game is really good in dealing with the concept of anti essentialism and that's a really good way to deal with gendered issues even beyond motherhood. 
this is amazing stuff and really makes writing this nearly 4k words essay worth it :'(( completely miss how Hornet changing herself and other nuggest add to anti-essentialism. thank you so much for pointing that out, for your time reading and writing this comment. appreciate you being a part of this amazingly wholesome community!",0.6120453476905823

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Rather than writing a long response I'll just steal the opinion of the commenter above and build from it.

So I don't think feminism was what Team Cherry designed the game as being about. What I mean is that, as a writer, I'm sure a future reader of my own comics could totally make a detailed analysis about how my story is actually about feminism.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"incredibly well formed analysis, but i think even in your own analysis you seem to contend with the fact that feminst themes are not necessarily the central one of the game. personally though, i think your analysis really shed some light for me on how feminist themes do play into the central message of the game, specifically in the termination of generational maternal trauma, especially as a metaphor for capitalism. throughout the game the way gms created the society, and crucially the citadel and underworks areas of pharloom is shown to be intertwined with her children, the weavers. herrah breaking free from the cycle of abuse and hornet carrying that on is literally how hornet becomes a better version of herself and makes the society of pharloom better.
ill take the time to write a full analysis later, but before i go id like to note that as per your comment on english not being your first language you have fluency and command of english i only see from those who have closely studied its craft. your tone is clear and mellifluous, and your prose is concise and direct in a way that shows the immense effort you've put into it. additionally your formatting and grammar indicate a level of perfectionism suited to higher platforms than reddit, and i'm not sure your technical skill level would be completely out of place in the annals of famous novelists and poets; it's very well constructed is my point.",0.6225867867469788

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Angry Joe came out with his review. He gave it a 6/10. 5 years from now these review scores are going to look like jokes when the culture wars over this game dies down.
A game that has this many industry leading aspects from animation, voice acting dialogue writing, atmosphere, combat movement, stealth gameplay etc getting a 6 just because you disagree with story direction is silly.
Another thing he doesn't realize is how much of an influence he is to the gaming community. 15-25 year olds are his core base and that age group has issues with thinking for themselves. They latch on to influencer opinions. Angry Joe for all his hatred of monotization, lazy publishers etc is going to influence the gaming industry to push out generic trash and not take risks.
What's even more sad is if the leaks didn't come out where a multi-month campaign by alt-right YouTubers didn't spam hatred for the game making it the mainstream narrative amongst young YouTube viewers based on the leaks, Angry Joe would probably be praising this game.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Gamers want games to be respected and seen as a legitimate form of art and storytelling (which they absolutely are), but reactions like the ones we have seen from the ""gaming"" community are so counter-productive for the mainstream to see games from that perspective.
I really enjoyed the game and I wish more people saw it and tried to understand the story and the writing like you did.
And that's a big part of it. I don't think anyone will understand the writing just by playing. You have to fucking think.
I love the line from Dunkey's review; ""Characters will do things you wont agree with and you'll have to turn your brain on and attempt to empathize with them"".
When you read a book, you don't just take everything at face value. You have to sit and go through different scenarios. You have to sometimes come up with explanations yourself as to why a character did something in order to understand that character more.
We study literature in our schools for this exact reason. Nobody would take such reductionist views from books like The Great Gatsby, Animal Farm, or 1984 as some players have from Last of Us Part II.
I think TLoU Part 2 is a big milestone in actually treating games as a form of literature in the mainstream.

I'm in the ""this game is a masterpiece"" camp so I may be biased but from what I can gather from most of the negative fan reviews I would hazard the guess that these boys aren't much of the ""reading"" types that value literature let alone understand complex character development and critical thinking. If these guys actually paid attention and enjoyed the typical books assigned in literature classes we would see a lot more thoughtful reviews (which does not mean you can't criticize the game) instead of ""I hate that they killed Joel! Abby bad! Foot stomp! Hmph!"" They probably also hated Romeo & Juliet because of the (spoiler alert) double suicide at the end and all the ""irrational"" decisions that led to that ending. Life isn't logical or rational, people are flawed and we all have the potential to make poor decisions in the heat of the moment. Heck, I still hold a grudge against a pizza place from 15 years ago that had an employee that was rude to me...
I LITERALLY watched a ""review"" with some kid taking a hammer and smashing his game box and cd to pieces. If that's not an indication of a juvenile and emotionally immature sector of the fan base then I don't know what is.",0.6298085451126099
comments discussing about the art of the game,I agree that maturity really has to do with enjoying this game. You have to go in in ready to think. It’s not just about shooting zombies. I loved the discussions that came up from playing this game.,0.6616379022598267

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Could not agree more. It honestly kinda just makes me sad that more people don't see it this way. I thought the game was a masterpiece because of how against the grain it went. It did an amazing job of humanizing both sides rather then just saying ""Here's the good guys, here's the bad guys. Bad guys go boom, yay you won."". Aren't people tired of the same old thing yet? Judging by their reactions I'd say I guess not.
At least the game sold amazingly well, and gives me hope we may see a third part some day. I hope if that happens, it goes against everyone's expectations as this one did.",0.6120280027389526

While I don’t think people who hate this game automatically have “low” expectations - surely anyone finished this game week 2 of release must have some high expectations, I agree with your message. It’s about if you can look beyond your own expectations and accept new perspectives - just like the characters’ journey in the game.
The game is very meta is what I’m trying to say. Clearly I don’t write for a living.",0.6180230379104614
comments discussing about the art of the game,I agree...the analysis was great,0.6002230048179626
comments discussing about the art of the game,"my one complaint was I wish they were harder on the trans and homophobia. Bf seemed to dance around it in a way that wouldn't offend anyone while GF was a little more pointed about it. There aren't ""two sides"" to homophobia and trans hate. It's not about agreeing with the lifestyle. If anyone doesn't like the game solely because they play as a woman, a gay woman, a buff woman, or because it has a trans character...you're a phobe and a dick and you shouldn't have a platform to spew hate under the guise of ""not agreeing with the lifestyle""
and for the reactionaries that are gonna jump and accuse me of saying people who don't like the game are phobes...no, that's not what I'm saying. Disliking the game is perfectly valid. Hating that Joel died..valid. Disliking the structure that forces you to play as the antagonist for a significant chuck...valid. the fucking need to pickup so much little shit...valid. There's lots of reasons, many I disagree with, but you know it's just a videogame and discussion is healthy, but plenty of valid reasons. There's criticism and disappointment. Then there's being a bigot. We should welcome EVERYONE that wants to talk about elements of the game or what people didn't like or what they would do different and we should SHUN everyone that disguises their toxic hate as ""reviews""
They shouldn't be afraid to take a strong stance anyway since the game is breaking all sorts of records in sales too. The hate is the minority, and PLUS if we successfully get this point across, more people who want to debate the game will feel comfortable knowing that we're welcome to listen non-hate stuff. If we weed out the bad guys from the discussion, people won't feel so defensive about not liking the game. Tolerating hate is not tolerance.
E: bigots, I’m not taking the bait. Go back to the other sub cause I am OUTRIGHT telling you I’m not tolerating it. Like I said, you’re entitled to an opinion, not an audience.",0.6231966018676758
comments discussing about the art of the game,"It really is. Its nice to see that the people who loved this game are delivering some excellent takes. Meanwhile the majority of haters seem unable to articulate their points beyond childish ranting. There are criticisms that ive seen but typically its nothing to do with the story, writing or MUH JOEL.
This covers a great point though. People finish the game but without an open mind they dont truly appreciate it. Its just as thought provocation and emotionally rich as the first game. Its sad that people are robbing themselves of that experience. But then again, the people who are upset seem to be those who hero worshipped Joel. And they probably missed the point of the 1st game.",0.6359220743179321

But as for why you aren't seeing many ""Meh"" people I think just comes down to the fact that if you view a piece of entertainment and are just relatively pleased or displeased you probably aren't going to bother discussing it much further than that or like diving deep into what the game meant to others and such, you just move on.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Fantastic write up!
As someone who's seen the game played all the way through I think it's a decent game with some noticeable issues (none of which are the existence of lgbt people, brown people, or women who dare to have biceps). Certainly not 10/10 material but not a dumpster fire like band-wagoners would have you believe either.
It's unfortunate that the review bombing and transphobia/homophobia (seriously, don't go to /thelastofus2. the rampant hatred spewed at minorities is ridiculous) make having genuine discussions about the game's actual issues difficult. Especially in regards to the irl poor treatment of employees at naughty dog.
On top of crunch I've heard from several different people that the developers were made to use actual images/videos of mutilated bodies as reference in the pursuit of realism with the game's violence (though I can't provide concrete sources for the rumors). Regardless, as tech increasingly approaches more realistic depictions I think this will become a more urgent problem in the gaming industry, with people having to embrace subject matter than can inflict real world harm to the psyche in pursuit of art or a paycheck.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Right, but you've gotten off track.
Is public perception relevant? Sure, if you want it to be.
Is public perception multifaceted and complicated? Sure. A ton of, maybe most of the criticism is coming from overgrown children mad about muscles or something. And some is coming from people who just genuinely don't like the game for perfectly okay reasons.
Are the opinions of professional critics relevant ever? Fuck no. They're clowns with very close relationships with publishers. Games journalists are punchlines for a reason. Their opinions never really reflect the quality of a game. Critics liking or disliking a game never means anything other than just that: critics like or dislike it.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Yea, Naughty Dog (and many many other companies) need to prioritize fixing their crunch culture going forward. That's for sure.
Game wise. It's a very well made game that isn't fun to play. It is gruesome. It is depressing. The first Last of Us game was also bleak and every other person you came across ended up dying. It makes sense that trend would continue here and it makes sense a former Protagonist would die. But still. It wasn't fun. So complicated feelings on it make sense. People disagreeing and discussing whether or not games should always prioritize being fun is fair.
But I will never take people who only review things the lowest or highest scores possible seriously though. It's the most Karen thing someone can do online. Gamer Culture™ has often talked about wanting games to be respected as art. Respected as one of the most profitable entertainment industries in the world. But then when something isn't wish fulfillment it seems like there's always a tantrum. Even just having diversity or a woman deemed not fuckable enough is treated like a betrayal. That needs to change if video game fans want to be taken seriously by people. Because it does make the metacritic reviews easier to dismiss when people review bomb a twenty hour game for its story when the game has only been out for eight hours. It does become less appealing to search for real criticism and discussion when you have to wade through transphobia, misogyny, and pure immature entitlement to get there. They need to be better too.",0.615850567817688
comments discussing about the art of the game,"Thank you for this writeup by the way. It's obvious you put real time and work into compiling and writing all of this.
That quote explains a lot. It is a divisive concept. That games don't need to be fun. As game makers strive to make an artistic impact I think the debate will become even more prominent. I mean in Film, Requiem for a Dream, and Moonlight are both beautiful artistic achievements. Neither of them could really be described as fun. Also though neither of them ask for thirty hours of active participation.
If people prefer to see something uplifting, prefer to be excited, prefer to be entertained that's perfectly fair. If someone wants to spend their time at the movies watching Fast and the Furious instead of Parasite there shouldn't be shame in that. But also like, people shouldn't buy a ticket to Sophie's Choice and complain it wasn't Inglorious Bastards.

The problem I have isn't that other people enjoy it or not, it's that many people are pretending that their opinions about the game are objective.
There are many who aren't just saying or insinuating ""I personally don't enjoy the (concept) of the game"" but rather ""the game is bad and all those who say otherwise are either lying or just plain wrong.""

""Evidence?"" Odd word choice. Do you think there is some way to prove the game is good or bad or something?
I'm not going to alter the facts listed in my both just to counter an opinion.
You think the only way NOT to legitimize them is to ""alter the facts in your post?""
That's some mighty odd framing you've got there.
And my post is just saying what happened during this entire thing, if that gives them legitimacy... okay?
Also, you may think you're being objective and to that I'll say two things.
There is bias even in terms of what ""facts"" you CHOOSE to include and exclude and how you present those ""facts.""
Being ""objective"" doesn't absolve one of any and all responsibility with regard to the consequences of your actions, at least not necessarily.

You need to write an entire dissertation on why exactly it didn’t work for you, and even then it’ll be dismissed as being wrong.
And God forbid you even mention the word revenge, because don’t you know it’s not a “revenge is bad” type of game? It’s actually about how *insert convoluted way of explaining how revenge is bad without using the word.” And yes, I know it’s not just about that. I’ve heard it all.

And on a personal note, Druckmann’s own history and statements about Israel makes it very hard not to side eye the whole “both factions are bad, but hey one side are psychopathic religious homophobic fanatics out to murder a trans kid, and the other side are real human beings driven to do bad things, but I’m still gonna show you half a dozen of them to humanize them.” Even their dog is more humanized than any Serapahite.",0.6017460823059082

You have to excuse us for saying that when people still fundamentally fail to grasp the most basic concepts of this game. When someone argues that Joel did nothing wrong to Abby, how on Earth am I meant to take that seriously. That is such a braindead take, it's like arguing that Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds is just really good at his job. How do you even engage with such a surface-level understanding of a narrative?

comments discussing about the art of the game,"The game is not trying to say “revenge bad”. People have this weird thing where art has a defined correct message. The writers didn’t sit there and go “hmm today we are going to write a story and the theme is revenge bad”. Now they may be saying “we want to write a story that examines the cycle of revenge, human kindness, etc, but they aren’t writing a game with the intention of having a theme. There isn’t a right or wrong answer to “what’s the theme of the game”. You as the person interacting with the art draw your own conclusions. So it’s not inherently bad writing for the game to have moments that contradict your interpretation of the game. I don’t think they really intended anyone to take away “Revenge bad”. In my opinion, the more interesting way to view the game is from this perspective. You start the game watching this terrible person murder your favorite character. You watch the grief consume Ellie as she loses more and more of her humanity in this hunt for Abby. Then you eventually swap to Abby, you slowly start rooting for her (and yourself) as she goes through the story. You realize she’s not just some evil person, she like Ellie is capable of empathy and courage but her grief over her fathers death drove her to lose her humanity as well. Neither of them is really a “villain”. They both just seek to avenge those they cared about. Its a story about bonds and grief and how violence and hatred can cause us to lose ourselves and our humanity.",0.6001740097999573

They accomplish nothing the whole game, they're a terrorist organisation set up initially to protest against martial law... during a pandemic.

It's NOT a retelling of a tale as old as time, but one that makes you think and examine your own thoughts, feelings, and biases.

In this particular case, OP made a post reviewing a game and was very conscientious about not spoiling anything in the post body, just as any professional game review outlet would do. If a user was on the fence about the game and wanted to check out a spoiler-free review here to decide whether to play it, OP's post provided that.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"damn this is the BORU of all BORUs where most of the comment section seemed to be split clearly into half. there's no ""eh they were both kinda mean"", all i see is TEAM OOP or TEAM GF
i kinda think they both went about this wrongly, but ultimately are just incompatible. as one of the 2 ""professional artists"" of the family, it is both frustrating to:
1) be asked to critique something when i'm off work, and i have no clue how to approach the situation since i dont know how honest i can be. will ask if its okay to be brutally honest then buy them a drink or something
2) BUT also not getting honest feedback from a fellow artist family member because art is subjective and they are also a professional. the more i look at my shit the more i have no fucking clue if this shit looks good or nah, same with music, and sometimes a fresh pair of eyes and ears can help figure it out
so i genuinely see both sides. i think people are really jumping the bandwagon on the ""context clues that gf clearly didnt wanna critique it"" because all OOP said was that she says its great and he's crazy for thinking there's more to it, and thats what OOP had an issue with. maybe i missed something but it feels like a lot of team gfs are pulling subtext out of thin air lmao. but then OOP also.... man it may be better to just try talking to her again, and if it continues, recognise the incompatibility than do this petty shit",0.6106888651847839

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Does no one else here work in the arts/arts education? Honest critique is a HUGE part of Arts education - learning how to give it, and learning how to receive it. Being honest when you think your loved one's work could be better isn't some crime against love, especially when THEY ASK. You can be honest while still being polite and loving. No one is helped by 'it's awesome! You're awesome! Everything you do is awesome!'
My partner and I give honest feedback about each other's projects all the time. I really appreciate when he tells me something I've made isn't doing it for him, because that means I KNOW HE MEANS IT when he tells me he loves something I've done. Is everyone here 12 years old? Why do you all expect only praise and head pats from the people you love? Emcouragement is more than just an endless positive feedback loop. Encouragement is also, you know, encouraging people to push themselves into new and better territory.
The only thing OP did wrong here was the set-up. He shouldn't have bothered. He knew she was lying to him and repeatedly refusing to build trust about this. He should have just ended it without the stunt.",0.6431207656860352
comments discussing about the art of the game,"I don’t usually comment, but I hadn’t seen this perspective yet so wanted to bring it up.
I have a little clay frog that my friend made for me. People have told me this frog it ugly, not well done, hardly looks like a frog, and VERY tacky. But I love it! I consider it “good” art! Probably because my friend made it for me and I love her! I may have rose-colored glasses on BECAUSE she is my friend and I love her, but I can’t imagine critiquing it because of my positive feelings for my friend! It doesn’t even occur in my brain to consider “bad” things about it.
Having had an ex who also produced music that was not a genre I liked, knowing it was his made me like it and regard it as good— likely solely because of my care for him. My mind didn’t suggest bad things because I don’t assess art done by people I love in that way; to me it is a piece of their soul and I only see the positive. I couldn’t have critiqued his music knowing it’s his, despite my music theory and performance background.
I think there is a solid chance that this is how this guy’s gf felt. Could also definitely be projecting hahahaha
But yeah otherwise, I agree with everyone else here. They aren’t compatible. He seems unable to take criticism and that probably heavily contributed to her unwillingness to offer critique. Honestly he seems like quite an insufferable person. I’d have Jo interest in ever being around a person who played a trapping-me game like that; to me that is far more fundamentally dishonest than giving “placating” answers when asked to assess a loved one’s art.",0.6432987451553345

I cannot spend my life continuously shitting on something he enjoys and puts time and effort into, so I know far, far more than I want to about this subject and say a lot of, ""Oh?"" and ""Interesting."" I support him and his efforts, assisting with editing and art creation for his content when he asks.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Maybe I’m an asshole but OP wasn’t manipulative, his GF was. Repeatedly lying about what she thought about his music was manipulative. Everyone saying she told him she didn’t want to critique his music is purposely obtuse or failed reading comprehension. Responding with “it’s great” when asked is NOT telling someone you don’t want to critique their work. It’s doing exactly what OP was complaining she was doing, placating him simply because she wasn’t mature enough or was too scared to be honest with him. If she had just been honest like he kept asking her to be, he wouldn’t have had to “trick” her into listening to some old song of his.
If OP was a woman complaining that her male partner wasn’t showing interest in her hobby/art & wouldn’t by give honest feedback, these comments would not keep the same energy. Comments very much give yall are mad that a man had the audacity to seek criticism from his woman partner. How dare he burden her with the weight of wanting honest feedback on his art/work. Like be forreal. She even admitted herself she never liked his music but only once shit escalated to a point and couldn’t lie her way out of. It’s been 7 years.

In a show, I love action and good writing/storytelling and Pedro pascal (obviously lol). I only played the first half of this game a long time ago but was also only recently told to watch this/reminded it exists - and I love it.
As I think you mentioned before, most game adaptations to shows suck. I was pleasantly surprised, to put it mildly, with how seriously this story was taken when it came to the show. The infected are actually kinda scary, and I've been on edge for more jump scares than actually occur. Not a love for me, but I'd imagine that was the goal of the producers to some extent, so props to them. It makes you think and anticipate within and beyond each moment represented, and I appreciate that very much. Good on them.
Anyway. I'm drunk and it's late. You're a pretty good writer, op, if you cared to edit. Don't judge cause I refuse to either especially right now. Trying to give a compliment.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"No, thank you!
Indeed it helps, but it still takes a lot of dedication to go over it in such a structured way! Prolly my biggest issue with any TLoU / Part II involved discussion is that there are too many thoughts and points of view to consider that I end up going on a tangent half the time... but can't deny it's one of the most appealing aspects of the game.
Look at me, die hard fan since 2013 and I still get emotional about talking about TLoU!

comments discussing about the art of the game,"""Also from what is suggested about Jackson they seem to take on new recruits and members to their community. We also know they would take in visitors as Joel explains that he traded some of his belongings for coffee at the end of the game""
Stuff like this is basically the whole reason why theres just ""game of this generation"" and ""the worst trash of this generation"" people. Like you can completely take every little piece and many times use your imagination/interpretation to say ""no no, this is because this and that"" and say that those who dont do that are just to dumb, ignorant or even just resent the game because theyre bigots/homophobes. Or you can just see what actually happened on screen, like what actually was and is and judge it by that.
Id say though that the necessity to piece stuff together or even interpret and imagine things to a story or game is a bad thing. For example, I recently red a comment on the Morpheus vs Neo fight scene in the Matrix, which said that the sparring program was designed so that Morpheus wins, so Neo landing a hit was already the sign that he is the chosen one. Because he broke the rules of the world he was in.
Now the thing is, this is just interpretation, which imo makes the scene even better, but, it is not necessary, the scene just worked perfectly. But if something is in question, and you need to interprete and piece stuff together to make it work flawlessly, its flawed.",0.6369955539703369
comments discussing about the art of the game,"Pretty much my experience. Like, I could've written that myself including the Hillcrest part.
Pacing of the game is part of why people were ""depleted"" at the end but that has been discussed before so I just tried to stay on my specific point. I think the fact that the game is beautiful, and the cinematic gameplay is attractive makes some people not pay attention to the story itself. We have to be objective, we all don't have the same ""priorities"", for me storytelling in this game is my number 1 priority, graphics and gameplay come in a clear second place. Butchering the story and characters that I care about can't be compensated with nicer graphics and gameplay. What NC tried to push as a ""revolutionizing"" story h driven games and pushing boundaries was nothing but an amateurish push for moral lectures. I remember a verse from an old song that goes something like ""if someone steals but then sacrifices himself (like in, sacrifices his life to save others), what should we do?"" And I can hear NC in the back, ""stealing is wrong!""
NC tried to ""push"" way too many boundaries, from both technical and moral points of view and the result was a beautiful but chaotic mess. If he had picked one maybe, just maybe, it would've been a different story (pun intended!)

I have since watched some of the cutscene compilations on Youtube and while sure, some of the cinematic setpieces are kinda cool, the companion scenes haven't convinced me I made a wrong choice.

If you didn’t like the gameplay itself that’s fine. But I think it’s silly to say you expected a better story when you just wanted a story that ties up neatly, when TLOUP2 is intentionally messy and supposed to leave you feeling dissatisfied.
Like that’s the whole point of the game, as a work of art. You’re supposed to feel uncomfortable. You’re supposed to grapple with the fact that you no longer like or relate to a character you loved.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I strongly agree with your take that the TLOU2 was an unneeded sequel. It has it's moments, especially in gameplay and environmental design, but, from a narrative perspective, it's essentially Bad Decisions: The Game.
I understand why Ellie would be grief stricken and filled with rage, but there were so many obvious ""turn back"" moments that I think any person would comply with. It just felt illogical, even for a person filled with rage, to keep going (especially to California). I think it's a neat concept for a game, and I understand why TLOU provided a great platform to test it out (with Joel being so beloved), but I just don't think it... worked.
And don't get me wrong, I like when developers make big swings. But I can't help but be a little bitter that such a big swing (and miss) is now linked to a game, TLOU1, that I consider to be near perfect in its scope and ambition.
EDIT: Un-related to my main point: I dislike when people try to deflect constructive criticism by saying ""Well, ya see. It's art. It's supposed to make you uncomfortable."" Like...

In my opinion it’s neither. Technically the game is top notch. Obviously the graphics are fantastic. The gameplay builds on what Part 1 did well and makes it better. It’s really well acted and the moment to moment writing is pretty good.
But the game suffers from its pacing. Cutting to a ~10 hour playable flashback in the middle of what seemed to be the climax of the game is a really bold choice. I understand what they were trying to do and I appreciate that they were willing to take risks, but it just throws everything off. (And it’s something I was really hoping the show would attempt to fix.) Then we return to climax and it’s not even the end of game.

Game enjoyment is subjective. Just because I love Elden Ring, doesn't mean the average person will. At the end of the day a rating doesn't tell us much.

There’s also the fact that as your read a review or criticism of something, you are placing importance on certain aspects of the review. For example, perhaps you prefer gameplay over story, or art direction over controls.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Nothing to do with the comment you’re replying to but…You’re the kind of person who hates on a game and believes rumors/memes about it despite real genuine reviews being available during release? Seeing there are people who has a lot of good things to say about it when the game released, and you chose to believe the rumors and memes instead of playing it yourself?

comments discussing about the art of the game,"First of all, keep in mind i was around 18 when the game got leaked, back then, and even now, i would rather want to hear what random people on reddit or the internet have to say than “critics” and “reviewers” where they get paid to give favorable reviews.
Since then, nothing significant has changed, but, i am much more careful of how seriously i take the information i read. With that being said, there haven’t been many cases where i was wrong with expectations based on what i read before watching a show, movie, listening to an album or playing a game.
With all of that answered, i give absolutely 0 fucks as to who reads what i say or if anyone reads at all. I felt the need to express my opinions, which i did, it just so happens that there have been plenty of comments from people willing to discuss with me.
Also, i am still waiting for the original commenter to show me EXACTLY what he/she thinks was written by AI and i will need proof or a legitimate reason as to why he/she thinks that.
Even if it was written by AI, which it wasn’t, who gives a fuck? Also, out of everything i said, the only thing he/she has to say at the end of it all was that it was written by AI? Thats a clicker brain if i ever saw one.",0.6518111824989319

comments discussing about the art of the game,"While one can laugh at this (and should - anytime you’re blaming someone else instead of yourself you’re fooling yourself) there’s an element here touched on that I think is important:
Video game reviewers aren’t video game masters. They shouldn’t be. They should be great writers and (for most of them today) excellent presenters.
It boggles my mind every time gamers make fun of a reviewer who makes a mistake in a game. They’re allowed to do that. They’re not e-sports players. Again, they’re writers.
One time I was working in an association for PR professionals as a tech guy. A PR professional criticized the association because we didn’t hire all PR people. I mean really? Do you want the servers to be run by PR people? Do you want HR run by a PR person (the answer is you don’t - even if it feels that way sometimes).

comments discussing about the art of the game,"If the goal of the analysis is to analyze the difference in between how TV can tell a story and how a video game can tell a story then you can absolutely still properly analyze it.
Both this and the OP’s other post are doing just that, discussing the technique video games have that TV just can never have- interactivity. Analyzing the impact interactivity had on storytelling is a fascinating topic, and I don’t think playing the game first means that it can’t be properly done.
Furthermore, thats ultimately a moot point because we are all biased. Everyone’s opinion on literally anything is inherently biased- it is completely unavoidable. Should we dismiss the criticisms book readers had of GoT? Should we say that no one in France can properly analyze French government because they are biased? Of course not.
It is, of course, wise to be aware of people’s biases and take them into account, but we shouldn’t say that one can’t analyze something solely because of bias. Because if that’s true then no one can ever properly analyze anything lol.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"<sarcasm> I'm glad that was a honest reaction. There's been so many dishonest ones with people lying about what their opinions are. </sarcasm>
The complaints in the 1:1 comparisons are precisely why so many changes were made. It's not about which delivery was better. You're already familiar with the game's scenes. It's what you know and expect, so in any scenes that copy the game, you're going to see any deviations as something wrong.
All of us who have played the game are looking at it with that bias. It will be interesting to see people who first saw the story in the show play the game and see if they feel the game or the show was superior in those scenes. I'd bet they prefer the show's versions since it will be what they already know.
My own opinion is that gameplay will tend to involve people more. You're not watching Joel and Ellie. You ARE Joel (or Ellie) and you're experiencing their journey first hand and not just a spectator. That will change your perspective. The important thing is the show allows an entirely new audience who isn't into video games to fall in love with the same story we've fallen in love with over and over.",0.6085516214370728
comments discussing about the art of the game,Yeah I agree with you. These are my favorite games of all time and the show absolutely did some things better. It’s so weird how Gamers can not see through their own bias,0.6095975637435913
comments discussing about the art of the game,"This is very interesting and at points compelling—until the point where you compare game scenes and show scenes 1:1 and declare how each feels. ""That's just, like, your opinion, man,"" and I think you're letting your original experience of the game tint your view of each.
I loved the games, but clearly it didn't hit me nearly as hard as it hit a lot of people in this sub. I don't find myself having such strong reactions to one line here or there as I see in this sub, and I think that's OK—it's cool to see people waiting to see certain things that I'd completely forgotten happened—but I also think that those things stick with you because they hit you a certain way at a certain time in your life and you can never replicate that, and while it's great that art does that for people, it's not really a great way to compare things because it's so distinct for every person.
I loved the show, too. I do think there were things they could've done better, and I think simply by nature of immersing yourself in a game for many, many times longer, you're obviously likely to get some more feeling of growth and attachment than the show would ever have been able to portray. I think they did a really good job, but nothing's perfect and there's always room for improvement that's worth discussing.
I think a lot of people liked the games as action games, and so a lack of infected in the show was disappointing to them like it wasn't to me (as I age, I actually want less action in my media—it tends to be the least-interesting thing on screen, for me), but I also think the criticism that the infected were too sparse is fair—they are, after all, the reason Ellie needed protection, and the whole reason for the journey at all.
I think that's my biggest agreement with the criticism I've heard. The other stuff really just feels to me like someone who placed the games in a very special place in their heart, and nothing will ever take that away, and that's great, but it's not a particularly level-headed analysis of the adaptation.",0.6420019865036011

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I’m a bigger fan of Baker and Johnson’s performance personally. I also like the cinematography more. Not to mention the music being much louder in the game. Sets the tone better.
I’m happy people like the show’s end tho. I showed the game’s ending to my mom and gf (who have both seen the show and loved it, but never played the game; they’ve seen some gameplay tho). My gf liked the show’s ending more, but my mom liked the game’s more.
Based on a lot of the comments I’ve read here, it really does feel a bit split on which medium executed it better. Ig it’s just personal preference. But bruh I just love the game’s so much more. The music not being loud in the show peeves me off a bit more than it should",0.6085063815116882
comments discussing about the art of the game,"I don’t disagree with much of anything you said, my two cents is just that games have a lot of, how do I say this…
When a gamer plays a game, the gameplay is the point and story is fluff.
On TV it’s flipped. I would have enjoyed seeing more infected fights, but that’s gameplay. It’s fluff on TV. It’s why most people don’t like watching others play a game. We’d rather be playing ourselves instead of watching.
Meanwhile, in the game, there’s so much gameplay that there’s tons of places to insert fluff(story) to build characters over a lengthy (much longer than a show) period of time.
So of course the game hits harder. And the show could / should have had a few more episodes. To their credit, though, the show cut nearly all the fluff(gameplay).",0.6088095903396606

I'd rather do something else with that time.
Now had I not played the game, experience might have been different. Not that I know but the gamer in me uses whatever free time I have to play games. So many stories out there and I'm kinda done with TLOU's world for some time.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"This was a very thoughtful post. 
There are two elements that seem to predict how people respond to the game. 
You've identified the first in your post: discomfort. The story is ugly, difficult, emotionally complex and asks the player to sit in feelings that are generally accepted to be 'bad'. It causes us to feel uncomfortable about how easily we can be swept into poor judgement and when faced with discomfort, we can either look within to the cause, or blame outward. For many, media is entertainment meant for comfort, so they feel betrayed by the developers. Part II is art.
The response by u/bakuhatsuda identifies the other: attention. This story demands your focus and to be immersed so that you resist the ego-protecting instinct to 'switch off' and blame the game for making you uncomfortable. The pacing of dialogue and the lingering camera and the haunting score are all in service of lengthening the time we have to weigh our own emotions against what we're experiencing. Without attention, it's impossible to connect and it's particularly bad for people streaming the game who are conditioned to react and interact, rather than to contemplate and respond.
So can you have empathy without being able to 'suffer' discomfort or being able to pay attention to the emotions of others? 
It's interesting that you feel that Korean gaming culture really latched onto hating this game. Forgive me, but as an urban Canadian, my impression is that in a lot of ways Korea can be as extremely hyper capitalist as America. The cutting edge of materialistic/consumerist culture worships comfort and demonizes 'trying too hard' or giving a lot of care an attention to things unrelated to money or 'success'. Given that baseline for a culture, is it surprising that online-forward communities are so reactively hateful toward this game?
I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm glad to hear from another person very far from me that they felt the intense humanity of this experience. You've written about vulnerability and empathy with thoughtfulness and kindness. I hope more people read your post. Thank you",0.646746039390564
comments discussing about the art of the game,"Thank you very much for your comment, brobrobrob. As you pointed out, in Korea this isn’t just an impression anymore — it’s the reality.
Interestingly, however, when it comes to film, the Korean audience tends to evaluate artistic quality more fairly.
So when I first played this game, I thought opinions might be divided, but that its artistic value would at least be recognized by many gamers.
But within the Korean gaming community, the overall response to this game is overwhelmingly negative.
That includes people who have actually played the game and even those who haven’t.
And as you mentioned, this reflects a broader cultural attitude toward media.
Content that tries to deliver deep emotional or moral messages, in other words, works that focus more on emotional resonance or meaning than on fun, often gets dismissed or mocked.
There’s really no clear solution. Over the past five years, the YouTube ecosystem in Korea has gained enormous influence as a form of mass media.
The opinions of certain streamers or reviewers are often accepted as facts or absolute truths, regardless of their accuracy.
A strong tendency toward collectivism over individual thinking also reinforces this pattern.",0.6321827173233032

comments discussing about the art of the game,"IMO there's an argument to be made that such a message would be better delivered in a less gameplay heavy game (maybe like a Detroit: Become Human or Life is Strange format), which is a view shared by some relatively more thoughtful Youtubers I watched. One guy I watched said he'd rather watch a long cutscene showing Abby's side than have to play the drawn out combat gameplay segments. In my experience, those long drawn out combat segments dissipated my energy and often left me drained when the next cutscene came around.
Sometimes, the drawn out combat segments, especially the hotel descent section, felt like the cruel embodiment of that phrase some people use against people who sympathize with an opposing side, immigrants, enemies, etc.: ""If you like X so much, why don't you live with them (with all the monotony that accompanies it)."" But no, you don't have to live with someone with all the monotonous moments that would accompany it to sympathize with someone. Such an important message as this game needs to be subtle and not overstay its welcome, which long combat gameplay segments can sometimes go against.",0.6010685563087463

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I agree so much with your take on the game. It's a masterpiece that makes people feel things in a way most other stories don't (not just games). If there's any artistic justice in the world, games like this will grow to become essential art that gets assigned to high school or college kids like the literary classics of the past. Yeah, I felt negative emotions during this game, but demanding only positive emotions from art is ridiculous. Imagine saying a breakup album is bad because it should have been all happy songs.
I agree that fandom is a problem too, though I'm not sure I agree 100%. It almost feels like your implication is that criticism of a thing by consumers is bad, and only the author can have any valid opinion on what characters would or wouldn't do. I certainly give the author's view precedence over others, but I wouldn't say they're always right by definition. This gets even more complicated when it's a branded thing and the original creator isn't involved. For example, I think the Star Wars prequels are terrible, but you can at least argue that Lucas was involved and the choices carry more weight for that reason. By the time you get to The Last Jedi, the Star Wars brand is really more about selling stuff than telling any kind of story that the creator of it feels must be told.
It seems like the view many fans take is that because something is called X and I identify as a fan of X, the art in question is automatically good if it's labeled as X. I believe this tendency to like anything labeled as X can be worse than the hipster-y tendency to hate things labeled as X because ""I'm a fan of the original X."" It's an especially insidious form of gatekeeping. You see this often in fandoms. ""You're not a real MST3K fan if you don't like Jonah exactly as much as Mike and Joel"" or ""You don't actually like wrestling if you prefer AEW and New Japan over WWE."" (These are admittedly very niche, but I'm sure we've all seen examples of this sort of thing - and maybe been guilty of it ourselves.) No one says those exact words, but they are opinions that can be enforced on a community through actions and implications.
This cuts both ways too. If someone blindly defended this game because ""it's The Last of Us and Neil Druckmann is always right,"" I wouldn't be any more convinced than I am by ""The Last Jedi is brilliant because Star Wars is always right."" Let's argue on the merits. It's always fair to criticize art and, while different people can (and will) come to different views, it's okay to think some art is good and other art is bad. That's how we learn to tell better stories and/or to identify good stories - or, at least, what we believe makes a good story.
I don't think you'd actually disagree with any of that, but I do think there's probably a little bit of space between our views, so hopefully I've articulated it well enough to provide a slightly different perspective.",0.6939438581466675
comments discussing about the art of the game,"I think you articulated yourself quite well! It was definitely an interesting perspective. ☺️
I definitely don’t want to imply that criticism from fans or consumers is a bad thing. I do think art is subjective and everyone’s opinion on the material matters. I agree that the creator’s view does take precedence over fan’s desires, but like you stated, it doesn’t make them right. I’m definitely not in the camp of “Neil Druckmann is always right” as that is definitely another unhealthy extreme.
I guess what I was trying to say is that there’s critiquing art and then there’s complaining about “I expected X to happen and it didn’t so this sucks”. I’ve read several reviews for the game, some who give it a 6/10 or so, and I can definitely see where they are coming from! I think there’s several reviews and valid criticisms from fans of the game, but the ones who take it to the extreme of “We wanted this and you didn’t give it to us, so you suck” are, I feel personally, flooding a lot of the negative reviews of this game.
I hope that makes sense? But like you said, I think we agree for the most part. Fandom is a beautiful thing that can definitely be integrated into the art form in some way, but when pleasing fans takes precedence over story, I begin having an issue with that.",0.6887190937995911

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Very well written.
We consume art because we appreciate the vision of the story-teller, but I feel this is something that has been forgotten over time.
I actually feel like it has never truly been present in gaming as a medium. There are many films and books (some less mainstream albeit) that continue not to pander to their audience, usually labelled as arthouse. Some of these films/books, like you mentioned, actually end up becoming the mainstream. Has gaming really had many moments like that? It feels as though the art form is still young and there have only really been a handful of moments with true innovation, particularly narrative related.",0.6551650166511536
comments discussing about the art of the game,"Thank you! And very good point.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Crossposting from a comment on /r/television:
I need someone to give me a rundown of what was so good about the writing in this game. I played it once and remember it being fairly rote (til the ending) and perfunctory, nothing about it felt all that complex or inspired.
Where I really thought it shine was in the direction and production. It is a beautiful game with stunning art direction, atmosphere and a fully realised world. Performances were pretty terrific.
But yeah the writing is held up by gamers as being some sort of literary masterpiece, but it's just the same general beats from infinite other post apocalyptic stories, and the characters were incredibly likeable without being all that complex. I honestly barely remember any details about them other than Joel was gruff and Ellie was a kind of resourceful, plucky kid. Are gamers just not that well read or something? I'm so baffled. People acting like this game was written by Shakespeare himself or like Eugene O'Neill or someone.
EDIT: I really gotta expand on this because it's genuinely making me crazy. So, I don't have an English degree. I read a lot, but I'm no Joan Didion. I watch a lot of movies, and I love certain TV shows, particularly shows with richly textured characters like The Sopranos. I recognise good writing when I see it, as many of us do - it's layered, ambiguous, but very specific and truthful, it begins to feel alive after a while, draw you in with things you can relate to and recognise that you otherwise may never have seen. Style is also a factor, and when aiming for something very specific it can all by in the style, like certain scenes or characters in The Sopranos carrying a weight that they wouldn't otherwise if the exact language, phrases and intentions were not accurately portrayed. You BELIEVE in Tony, Christopher, Paulie because you RECOGNISE them, they're real people, they exist. Likewise, the world around them has a pulse, it feels like a self-sustaining organism that exists with or without them. I don't really know if I'm making sense, but what I DO know is that it's probably the greatest written show of all time, though I've never seen the Wire. What I hear, though, is that The Wire is every bit its equal.
I guess what I'm saying is that the more literary, ie. truthful, earnest, ambiguous and yet specific that something like a TV show can be, the more successfully it can dramatise things so minute like pulp in orange juice and use that to build WHOLE LIVES that you come to recognise yourself in... the better the writing, right?
Where on Earth do people get off thinking a kinda awesome zombie game with a likeable duo at the heart of it, killing people with bricks but barely expanding on who they are... is somehow in the upper echelon of works of literary merit? Who truly believes this that aught to know? Anyone? Or is it just fanboys online?
EDIT 2: I also gotta add another little condition of great writing - revelation. The writer actually revealing something they truly believe, have experienced, have gone through, ARE going through that makes the writing that much more pungent and truthful. An honest reflection of internal life as a representation of an external life. Using emotion to fuel imagination and create something real.
Watching The Sopranos with the knowledge that David Chase created it because he ""needed therapy"" and that he based Livia on his mother, you begin to understand why it came out swinging so hard. It really was what he was going through. His NJ upbringing, Tony's struggle to comprehend his own mind, to contend with his demons... it's all a real human being's internal life being dramatised for our enjoyment.
Sam Shepard said ""catharsis is getting rid of something. I'm not trying to get rid of my demons. I want to shake hands with them."" His work is just that - shaking hands with his demons. Some of his darkest thoughts must have gone into his work because he goes to some fucking emotionally harrowing places.
Why do people think Neil Druckmann is some sort of Nobel Laureatte? Even Ann Rice managed to dramatise the loss of a child in her first book and it SHOWS. Where in TLOU has Druckmann told us anything so revealing about himself?
I'm losin it man",0.6554321050643921
comments discussing about the art of the game,"I have been thinking of Kojima this entire time and I'm glad you mentioned him!
Unlike most anyone else whose name is bandied about in relation to the creative direction of any AAA games, Kojima is one of the few (alongside Miyamoto maybe, and some others) whose vision and intentions I take at face value. The man IS inspired by film, but his sandbox is so vast in the gaming sphere that he has fully embraced, transformed and forwarded the entire medium time and again and so why wouldn't he stay in it and be proud of it?
The writing in MGS tends to be batshit crazy, convoluted and nonsensical but it's also incredibly earnest, emotional and creative. It's clearly one man's personal vision. It's not aspiring to be taken seriously. It takes itself seriously enough already that it doesn't need that external validation. It's like that Sam Raimi quote, ""take the material seriously, but not yourself."" Kojima seems to revel in his own imagination, winks at the audience and does things just because he wants to. But he never undermines his own writing. You play MGS and it's very clear that the stakes are VERY high and everyone is VERY invested in the outcome of their own story. But Kojima is having fun. It's terrific stuff.",0.6127017140388489
comments discussing about the art of the game,"I love this, you've successfully condensed a pretty great observation into a succinct point. I was trying to say exactly that really with my comment about the ""direction and production.""
Gamers don't actually know what is and isn't ""writing,"" because they obviously aren't reading it. The game just had such an incredible level of verisimilitude that they latched onto its storytelling as some sort of work of written genius.

We can say a game is overhyped or hyped in the wrong way without drawing these bizarre conclusions. Every medium has this happen, and all the aspects of a game can be overhyped, not just writing. This is just a general thing with humans.

It's just a bunch of humans acting like humans while they try to survive.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Well, I don’t think it’s about being disconnected. Maybe for some people. It’s more just a reality of being an enthusiast in pretty much any hobby. Winos get huffy about wine that tastes boring or bland or doesn’t meet their standards. Guitar players get very specific about tone woods, pickups, strings, electronics used. Book readers have authors they usually go-to, and have critical things to say about books that don’t meet their standards.
I don’t think it has anything to do with being disconnected. It’s about being passionate and refining your tastes through the years. An enthusiast can’t play all the good games they’ve played over the years and just act like the bad ones aren’t bad. However, they can understand that many games that enthusiasts would consider bad, are just fine and plenty fun for casuals. The mature enthusiasts already understand that.
But it doesn’t mean they should stop being critical. The industry is massive and can cater to both audiences. I think the enthusiast crowd just wishes the catering was a little more balanced than it is right now, as the casuals certainly have no limit of choices to play and enjoy.

Our time is valuable and playing anything is a waste of time. We already know what we like and enjoy, so of course we'll deviate to something that fits our taste, or critique a game that we like but has executed certain aspects badly. We do this for everything in our lives. As we get more experienced in one thing, our standards increase.

i would simply describe them as a non-gamer really exploring gaming for the first time. that’s okay obviously, but i think there’s a huge difference between a casual gamer and a non-gamer.
casual gamers are still people who PLAY games with some degree of frequency. they may not be AS skilled or understand EVERY aspect of game design, but they know what they’re doing to some extent. if i may make an assumption from how you’ve described her, your friend sounds like the type that needs to constantly look down at the controller just to be reminded what the buttons are. i don’t believe the average casual gamer needs to do that",0.6022375822067261
comments discussing about the art of the game,"Arcade games were the kings of ‘easy to learn, hard to master.’ Simple controls, a 2d perspective, but that simplistic gameplay increased in challenge fast. They had addictive gameplay loops that made you want to keep trying. 
What op’s post is about is design language, I think. Controllers now have like ten buttons and by and large games are 3d. Even if you’d never touched a game in your life, you can figure out the goal & gameplay in pac-man far more easily than, say, Cyberpunk. Moving in 3d space and having an intuition for how to use a camera, which items and parts of the environment are interactable, enemy ai, and so so many more things. Razbuten’s girlfriend reviews on youtube are a way more fascinating, in depth look at this imo. 
We are blessed today to live in a world with an absolutely plethora of games for everyone. Unfortunately, this is a rabbit’s paw situation where this makes many AAA games feel desperate to keep their large audience playing at all costs. If you have hundreds of games at your fingertips (on top of paid games having to compete with f2p) it’s less likely a player will stick with one that’s tough and confusing. You can switch back over to tik tok or whatever too. The attention market is CRAZY now in general. It’s not like when I was a kid and I had like three games total and got new ones rarely. If there’s too much friction, many people just get frustrated and quit. Those with a lack of game design language knowledge will quit even faster. When your title has a 200 million dollar budget, you can’t afford to have that. The games gotta go down smooth.
Luckily for us, we have the whole indie market and some AAA games too after Dark Souls came on the scene. ",0.6092730760574341

I feel like it is worth pointing out that, while you aren't wrong, there is A lot more to all of this than simply casual vs hardcore gamers.
Games used to be released complete, there was no ""oh we'll just fix it later or add that later or finish it when we have time. Games were released as a finished product not a work in progress. If games sold incredibly well then you might see a re-release or a definitive version come out later.
Nowadays games are being released half finished, riddled with bugs and they never get around to finishing or fixing them because they've already moved on to making the next cash cow game.

reading, I would turn back{pages} whenever I wanted to compare sth. or to relive it, I realized a thing, [repeatedly} re-read if didn't understand it, stick on drawings and details...;
when we're watching(preferably on our big screen!), I rewind as much as needed, likewise if might have lost something, point some details I know/noticed out, we comment but without interrupting, we may discuss/monologue later, I help enjoying Soundtracks I can pick out, I want to laugh, I kinda want to be afraid, I want to cry, I want to sing/hum along, I want to cheer, {with the appropriate pieces}sometimes I want to feel horny, I want to appreciate new Art styles, I want to coo, I want to rizz myself, I want to enjoy myself, I want to feel!...(...because that means I'm still alive(and a man)) I also found getting the best graphics quality matters here!;
when I Game, I like to take as much time as I can, check out every mouse hole, option, interaction, try if I can find bugs, I switch all the sounds on especially while checking stuff out, and using for it my best headphones available - at the very least once - is an ultimate goal, I tend to pass on an easiest difficulty first, foremost, and maybe even only, in spite of being a completionist[and challenging myself at least on the constant basis], if it is not necessary to do otherwise, also, meanwhile I enjoy vast majority of Music, it's been my newer Love to simply take the Tracks in in awe/bouncing to Them/other way, so a menu may be my first ""hype stop"", I re-read and rewatch for understanding and really like it, and again, I want to feel, I want to live;
listening to Music, turning up volume(and -phones working well) makes a big difference, melodies are pretty much always good, in doubt push your headphones deeper, listen to more instrumentals, check out other languages, if you can, move to the rhythm, tap, stomp, sing along, just to feel alive!, I re-listen in different tempos and pitches and maybe even try out beautiful messes resulting from applying the most basic lyrics-muting feature with Songs I already liked, too.

Realistically, the devs did nerf the game about 2% with some quality of life tweaks, but it's still really close to their original vision, and not at all indicative of a general downwards trend in difficulty that we could expect with upcoming patches. Team Cherry continues to want the same level of endgame difficulty they released the game on, but are willing to let players ease into it a bit better with earlygame boss nerfs.
I firmly believe the devs consider their movement, and bosses, and exploration to all be individually fun, and do not think of their game as a challenge/effort/improvement = dopamine simulator.

Let's argue nothing is perfect. Nothing. But if you judge a game solely on if it's flaws then you are doing your audience a disservice. In my opinion a gamen should be judged on what it's trying to accomplish. You should judge it on its merits.
TLOUII is a story driven action game
Does it tell a cohesive and engaging story?
Does the gameplay get in the way of the story?
Do you feel like the game didn't waste your time?
Was the sound design good or not?
The controls?
Were there any gamebreaking issues making the game unplayable? Crashes, glaring bugs etc.
If it destroys all of those expectations while accomplishing those things and makes me feel good playing it, then to me that makes it a ""masterpiece""",0.6066305637359619

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Exactly this. A lot of the criticism is valid, but I'm seeing no praise of where the game is great. They do also need to know what's good so they know what is best to keep. For example, we need to be shouting that the movement is fantastic. Otherwise the people who want COD movement will be the vocal minority, and the devs will potentially patch to cater what is asked for. Basically, you should be giving the pros and cons... Not just the cons.
While the bugs/glitches need to be ironed out, and the game needs bigger maps (which both are a given), I think for the most part we should let them cook. At the end of the day, everyone has different opinions. Where one thing is changed for the better for one person, the next person thinks it's changed for the worse. They've smashed it with each update and are delivering on what we asked for generally speaking with the game as a whole. Let's not slam the devs constantly as they are no doubt working tirelessly to give us the best game they can while under EAs corporate thumb. They've given us the best shooter we've had in years, and no doubt themselves want it to be improved over time. They should be praised for this.

I kinda understand this because, even though I agree with most of the criticism (like 90%), the sheer number of posts and hyperbolic over the top bitching can get exhausting at times.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I'll respond to this post with a few points that might reasonably apply to others.
The word ""apologists"" is somewhat incendiary; I'll give you that. But in it's classical sense, an ""apology"" is just a defense, and it was in that context that I intended the title. This letter takes the form of an attack, and it warrants a defense from people on the other side of the issue. I'm definitely not the ""end-all-be-all of video games,"" but I've played a lot of video games, I know which gaming elements frustrate me, and I can articulate why.
...TLOU2 was an amazing experience for so many other people. If you disliked the gameplay, then I can understand why you don't care for the game, but your arguments to defend your opinion (characters dropping into combat section, restricted resources for fights, dogs, and stalkers) are petty at best. Yes, that was purposeful, but most of us consider that a bonus make the combat more fun.
I don't mind being called petty, but you get that you haven't actually offered any reasons for why my complaints don't matter, right? Does the entire weight of your argument rest on the backs of all the people who liked this game? Do raw numbers exclusively determine the value of a work of art? I think that's a dangerous position, and I would argue that there's merit in distinguishing between the quality of a piece of art and the popularity of a piece of art.
First question: did you play TLOU? If you did, did you expect anything different from TLOU2? Second question: did you really expect Doom or Wolfenstein from TLOU2?
I definitely played the first one. Still one of my favorite PS3 games. And I think I admitted that some of the issues in this game's level design might have just been artifacts that I was more willing to overlook in 2013. But I think it's somewhat disingenuous to call this game ground-breaking if it's essentially just repeating the same gameplay loops that we were all okay with in 2013. And I certainly didn't expect Doom or Wolfenstein. For reference, I was willing to play a ton of RE3, warts and all--and that game had a lot of warts.
I said this to my wife (she didn't care; she was only listening to be polite): I think TLOUP2 is kind of a victim of its predecessor's success. Days Gone already borrowed heavily from the original's ideas, repackaging all the crafting and stealth and zombies into an open-world package that felt like an open-world successor to the game I loved in 2013. Days Gone had a painfully straightforward story and some pretty terrible characters, but it made up for its deficiencies in player freedom and raw fun. To go back to something far more restrictive feels pretty regressive.",0.6023167371749878
comments discussing about the art of the game,"I respect your civil approach here, and welcome your discussion.
I will say that for me personally the gameplay was fantastic. Gameplay is very much a love or hate kind of scenario between players, and so there isn't much room for debate here.

That being said (and this is coming from someone who thought Part I was overall better than Part II), I actually enjoyed the gameplay and combat sequences. Then again, I think the purpose and quality of this post juxtaposed with the probable reaction from those in this sub just shows how subjective the gaming experience really is. I mean, that's why the concept of a ""genre filter"" exists in nearly all mediums of entertainment. You like what you like, and chances are it ain't the same as the person sitting next to you. There's no right or wrong here.
Not everyone is going to agree on how good or bad this game is. It just won't happen. People have their opinions and are entitled to them.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Funny, I left a comment about Joels death a week ago which basically follows the same thought.
There is very clear symbolism if you examine the scene.
Joel effectively represents the player, having been the player character of the previous game.
Abby represents Neil Druckmann, since she is the Mary Sue of the game.
The golf club represents a golf club.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Theres way too much in life to worry about petty things like that.
I look at it like this. Ban and delete away. People are still going to disagree with you on certain topics and not everything needs to be defended or labeled as offensive. And certainly being as big as a game designer or as low as a reddit moderator has no affect on where I am in life.
We all need to respect each other and accept ideas and thoughts that people have the right to have different views and opinions that we may not like or agree with. I accept that with certain things in this game. I have to. It's been done. Whether I like it or not. And theres alot to like besides the criticism. Nothing wrong with that.

It's frustrating, because the game does have undeniable issues that need to be talked about, but at the same time, it also does a lot right that should also be discussed. It just seems as soon as anyone brings up anything opposing anyone's view, downvote city.

Seriously read up on the history and development process of the TLOU franchise. Druckmann isn’t some genius that had it all mapped out and knew exactly what he was doing. He had plenty, and I mean plenty of help getting the first one going and took plenty of credit for things he didn’t do.
In this game he was left to his own devices and it caused the company backslash and even his own reputation. He sat on the investment and hype of the first game and just let his own ego take the wheel. The guy’s a raging narcissist.",0.6063740849494934

Why are you reusing my words without understanding what they mean? You aren't doing yourself any favors.
Not sorry you don't like when your ""sick own"" is turned around on you. It's what happens when you have no basis but emotion and poor judgement for your opinions.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I remember it being kind of development hell. They made this cool conceptual work and pushed it as real gameplay to get investors. The art director was the one to shape it into an actual game. These reviews are pretty much what i expected. I'm sure there's a good game there for some, but majority of people will be turned off by some rough gameplay or weird decisions. I bet older gamers used to seeing Daikatana ads will like this game more than someone who has only seen game previews online",0.6021825075149536
comments discussing about the art of the game,"I feel like the “art director basically being the one to shape it into a real game” is becoming somewhat of a recurring theme in overhyped games. The look of the game gets people hyped before they realize that “the look” is the only thing special, whether it’s the art direction or even the look of the gameplay. Now the art guy has to conceptualize the rest of the game because his shit was what lured people in.
The first mistake is creating “fake gameplay trailers” and not because it’s inherently dishonest. If you can somehow end up living up to that trailer with your eventual product, then fine go crazy, but thats a huge gamble. Developers often create an impossible goal post before realizing that half the cool stuff they’ve done in the trailer is unfeasible.
Meanwhile devs like Nintendo are historically tight lipped about even their most hyped games (cough Tears of the Kingdom) and they’re probably better off for it. They have a great system of checks and balances.
Even Sony probably could have released some kind of footage of Spider-Man 2 by now if they really wanted to, but it’s always smarter not to jump the gun, especially on games that need to be good.",0.608940839767456
comments discussing about the art of the game,"As an artist myself, that doesn't check out hahaha
All jokes aside, that could be true. I didn't want to give the art director undue credit if his input directly led to the current state of the game, but going by what I've read he seems to be the only person who did the job initially required of him (aside from Mick Gordon).",0.653656005859375

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I dont get this sentiment. Their own website breaks down what the numbers roughly mean
8 - Great
These games leave us with something outstanding to remember them by, usually novel gameplay ideas for single-player or multiplayer, clever characters and writing, noteworthy graphics and sound, or some combination thereof. If we have major complaints, there are more than enough excellent qualities to cancel them out.
Examples include:
The Outer Worlds
The Division 2
Kingdom Hearts 3
GreedFall
Sounds about right to me.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I hope you understand my meaning. I don't say spiderman looks bad, I am just saying, it's 7~8/10 game, which is fine, even great, but it's not a game that deserve that much hype.
This might be a simple phrasing issue but one should be careful about making such absolute statements when dealing entirely with their own opinion. I mean, it may only look like a 7~8/10 game to you personally but that means nothing to anyone else. As such, saying that the game that ""deserves"" that much hype makes it sound like you are not just saying that the game is not as good as some make it out to be but also that your opinion is somehow more important than that of others.
It is kinda like when someone says something is ""overrated"". If you have hung around this subreddit enough, you have probably heard more than a few people say that such and such popular game is ""overrated"" but all they are really saying with such a statement is that those who did really like said game don't like it as much as they think they do. That their opinion must somehow be poorly thought out.
You list some games that you think are ""perfect"" and that is great. Heck, I love some of those games myself but everyone is going to have a different list and for different reasons. No one person's list is more correct than another because opinions are not meant to account for everyone, just the person who holds said opinion.
This is where I actually value (at least some) professional game reviews (and not the stuff you find from gaming youtube pundits and the like). In some of the better game journalism outfits, there is a certain expectation to take a step back from one's own opinions and look at a game from a wider angle. To understand that sometimes a game is pretty good and that some will value it and some won't.
Look, there was a time when I overestimated the value of my opinions in a pretty big way. I remember lecturing people for listening to pop acts like The Backstreet Boys or similar. I would go on and on about how they should listen to ""real"" music and that there is no good reason for modern pop acts to be popular. After a time, I found that it is not nearly as simple. It may baffle me that someone would want to go see a Miley Cyrus concert but those that enthusiastically do so are justified in their decision simply because they enjoy it. It is not my place to judge their taste and nor it is my place to judge the pop star for being a good pop star. I understand that I am not the intended audience and that my opinion in such matters means nothing as a result.",0.6274632215499878

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I don't get these kinds of comments.
I am not going to spend 60 dollars on a game without doing some research. Research includes reading through reviews. I find reviewers who seem to generally share my opinion or at least I understand how they formed theirs.
I'm seeing a bunch of reviewers give this game a nice solid score. That leads me to think this is a solid game. Solid enough that I would feel fine purchasing it at full price.
If the scores were low then I would be hesitant to buy the game.
You don't just ignore the opinions of others, you try to understand them to make a choice.
Now the other thing you are talking about is a different subject. What do scores actually mean? I actually dislike the 10 point system because 2 and below I'd ignore. I have no idea what a 9.5 is vs a 9.",0.620020866394043

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I am probably going to word this poorly but these games have the narrative front and center and that's why they seem more like art to you and others. I think that's misleading.
I humbly suggest you try Hollow Knight and other games of similar style, like Ori, where few words are actually spoken, games like Dark Souls where the story isn't given to you just by going through the game and Outer Wilds which I am not gonna say what it does but is surely going to put things into a different perspective.
Personally I dislike TLOU2 for many reasons, but the thing is regardless of my opinion of it, it's like Hollywood storytelling, closer to a movie which is why people like yourself I think are more likely to consider it art or high art, which it is, but so is almost every game in its own way, most of what you will read on this sub at least.
Disco Elysium, I love it, but it's not as deep as people like to make it out to be, it doesn't really explore any of the ideas that you come across, save for existentialism, the rest it just throws in there. It does other things brilliantly, like conversing with your thoughts etc. It still is art though undoubtedly.

Did not compare games based on plots, did not mention my favorite games or type of game, did not say hollywood storytelling is inferior.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I think the part that's frustrating for me as someone who loved the game (and also happens to write for a living), is that there's a difference between a narrative choice not working for you and calling a narrative choice ""terrible writing"".
u/brianstormIRL I'm not saying you're saying this as adamantly as other people I've seen, but the fact remains that a lot of people who are extremely against this game's narrative choices claim it has ""the worst writing ever"" and that's just not true.
This choice definitely worked for me, but I understand why it didn't work for others. I hated the switch to Abby at first, and looking back on it hours later, I love how I grew to feel about her as a character. Does this make me right and you wrong? No, not at all. People react to stories differently and that doesn't make the story ""good"" or ""bad."" On the other hand, there are legitimate ways to complain about writing, it's just a shame that with these highly divisive pieces of art (TLOU2 and The Last Jedi - another piece of bold storytelling I absolutely adored) it seems impossible for people to separate objective views and subjective views.
It comes down to amateur criticism becoming so hyperbolic that it's almost impossible to have a meaningful discussion. I think both of you ARE having a meaningful discussion right now, and that rules, but I see far too many arguments about this game that treat opinions as facts, and then narrative choices people don't agree with instead become ""sloppy, amateur writing and disrespectful to characters.""

comments discussing about the art of the game,"I'd say ""dated"" rather than ""outdated"". It looks amazing for a game originally released nearly a decade ago, especially with the remaster, and it still compares favourably against many current games. It no longer looks like the state of the art though.
It's one thing to look at them side by side and say ""it doesn't look that different, and the old version still holds up really well"", which is entirely true. However, this doesn't account for how significantly even minor differences in quality can affect people's experiences of a game like this as expectations shift over time (especially with performance capture being such a focus). There's a reason why so much additional time and effort is put into art, animation, and rendering techniques for such a seemingly minor impact on the final product, and that doesn't apply any less to an existing game than it does to a brand new one, provided you have the money and resources to make the upgrade.
Ultimately, it comes down to what the studio wants people to experience playing the game for the first time. They want people thinking ""wow, this is amazing"", not ""wow, this holds up exceptionally well"". If they have funding and people available to work on it, and think it will sell, then by all means it makes sense to put in the effort, especially given the existence of the sequel and the efforts to expand their audience.",0.6520980596542358

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Great idea, go for it. Personally I appreciate that this kid took the time to articulate real, concrete frustrations about the evolution of the game shared by many long time players, and he did it without a bunch of angry personal anecdotes.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"The climate of the subreddit is due to Bungie and their work. With that in mind most of these reviews are probably true.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Seeing these issues in IT and known for a while what Bungie is experiencing is not unique to them.

Pair all that with the fact that on it's face, the vocal majority online have only negative things to say. This will affect morale of the troops working overtime, and also being hammered into them from the higher ups who are also reading these comments.

I think the particular thread was about old armor and gear textures going hd or something. There are many talented 2D and 3D artists within the community and I don’t think it’s crazy to assume that at least a part of them would be stoked to see what they made make it into the game in some way. I work professionally as a graphic designer and I wouldn’t think twice before working on updating assets given the opportunity, even if I’m not ultimately paid for it. I’m sure there are probably legal and managerial roadblocks to that, but it’s not something that could not be worked out, especially regarding attribution, copyright and crediting. But the fact remains that there are a lot of people who put a lot of effort trying to contribute by sending feedback and even working out solutions for things Blizz themselves see as problems and giving them a path to more actively contribute would solve at least some of those problems.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"Just so I’m clear, are you saying that developing a game for hardware that isnt as powerful as its competition should not go through a price increase, despite the level of effort and the cost of living increase?
$60 is for the base game. I am not trying to defend the cost of a game maintaining its price despite its age. As someone who recently took part in a Steam sale, I understand your point. If you want to talk about price over time then there’s a different discussion to be had over whether video games are considered art and if they are why are there different expectations in the price of a game vs. paintings or sculptures.
Adjusting for inflation, a $60 game from 2005, value remaining steady should be $98 today. Therefore games have been cheaper. $80 is still less than $98. Factor in the amount of content and yeah. Bringing up MK8 was originally from 2014 brought to 2017 on a completely different platform that would require work such as debugging for compatibility, cleaning up assets, and adding QoL features then it is definitely a value.
I am not trying to insinuate privilege. What I am saying is that the industry is unsustainable.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"It's such a classic gamer comment. They like to go on and on about how games are works of art and should be taken seriously, yet at the same time they refuse to engage with them as you would with works of art, now claiming that they're just fun timesinks to fuel your escapism and shouldn't be taken so seriously. Like gamers are either unable or unwilling to see through even the thinnest layer of allegory and metaphor. Make a small, greedy, hook-nosed, big-eared creature that poisons your drinking water, then give it green skin and call it goblin, and suddenly gamers can't see the obvious Jewish stereotype they're presented with. ""Stop reading so much into it, it's just fun fantasy, jeez!""
Same with everybody's favourite apolitical gem, Skyrim. It has a dark-skinned population of refugees who live in a ghetto and are constantly being hassled by the local light-skinned authorities, being blamed for crimes they didn't commit just because of who they are, but because they got red eyes and pointy ears it's totally not about a real life population, stop trying to ruin my escapism!",0.6127818822860718

comments discussing about the art of the game,"This is in no way controversial. Neil Druckmann has said that he doesn’t want player choices to “break” his characters. So you get to do some jumping, shooting, and climbing, but only in carefully contained areas with given outcomes. Then you get knocked out in a cutscene and taken elsewhere, or stood down in a standoff after shrugging off a hundred bullets already.

comments discussing about the art of the game,"It would mean the world to me and many other players, if you provided us the option to voluntarily pay you money to allow you to produce bigger, better updates, more frequently.
I feel like this could be a cool concept. Diehard fans that have some extra cash that they wanna give to the game will find ways to give it to the game regardless. So maybe they could set up like a voting system thing maybe? Like, they give supporters of the game a poll of (lets say 3 options) about some vague ideas/mechanics (to not spoil the next update I guess) and with that, they get to support the game monetarily, as well as give feedback I guess",0.6201320886611938
comments discussing about the art of the game,"Your language of ""missing"" suggests that the game is incomplete or unfulfilled or in some way wanting. You also write as if these are things that would improve the game but aren't quite essential to its success. I agree with the latter, but I don't think the former is a fair negative evaluation of the game. That isn't to say you are negatively evaluating the game on those grounds, but it seems you/others might be! If they aren't criticisms, ignore that point :)
Having fan support for certain features is a nice thought, but on the face of it doesn't seem wise, for the creation/implementation would become contingent on support for particular ideas rather than the game overall, so the implementation of some ideas would be at the expense of other ideas, to the dismay of fans who supported unrealized ideas. There are surely ways to design funding to avoid this kind of scenario, but they also get in the way of overall funding. It also gets in the way of creator control and vision: these ideas may have been part of an initial plan for the game, but the creators have changed that vision and come up with new (and better, in some cases) ideas! To fund an entire team dedicated to balancing fan want and designer control would be a large ask, both financially and critically.
These are just rough thoughts/reflections in light of your post, but I hope that all makes a little sense! For my own part, I love what the creators have done with the game, how they've made it available, and how they've balanced it all against the initial trailer. I might prefer some changes, but that's true for any artistic endeavor/consumer product, and considering their initial circumstances, my preferences are far outweighed by HG's virtues.",0.6099616289138794
